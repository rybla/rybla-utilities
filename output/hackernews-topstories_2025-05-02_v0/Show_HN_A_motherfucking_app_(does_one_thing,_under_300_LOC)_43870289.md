This is a Motherfucking App.
============================

And it's fucking flawless.

Why the fuck would you need this?
---------------------------------

Because you're sick of bloated, dopamine-dripping apps that yell at you with “daily streaks” and “mindful reminders” while tracking your every move like a horny surveillance state.

Features?
---------

*   Opens fast. Like, immediately. No splash screens. No brand animations. Just works.
*   Dark mode? Of course, motherfucker. It’s 2025, not the Dark Ages.
*   No tracking. No bullshit. Your data stays where it belongs — the fuck away from us.
*   Built-in “Do Nothing” button, because sometimes, doing nothing is productivity, bitch.
*   Free. Because why the hell should you pay to open a goddamn to-do list?

This app respects your time
---------------------------

No sign-up. No login. No stupid onboarding carousel with cartoon animals.

You open it. You do the thing. You close it. That’s it. Your grandma could use this app while drunk on box wine and still beat your productivity stats.

Not for everyone
----------------

If you want a pastel gradient moodboard with 12 types of haptic buzzes and weekly serotonin reports, fuck off to Silicon Valley. This app is for people who actually want to get shit done — or at least pretend to, while looking cool as hell.

Need a break?

Do Nothing

Do One Fucking Thing
--------------------

 Do It

### So what is it?

It’s a to-do list. It’s a note app. It’s a calendar. It’s none of that. It’s a vibe. It’s a middle finger to every overengineered startup that’s ever wasted your time.
