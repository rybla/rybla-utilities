# Spotify Moves To Bypass Apple Payments After Landmark Ruling

Spotify has submitted an iOS app update that would allow US customers to [use payment options beyond Apple's system](https://www.theverge.com/news/659891/spotify-ios-app-update-apple-payment-rules), the company said Thursday. The move follows Wednesday's Epic Games v. Apple ruling, which prohibits Apple from taking a cut of non-Apple payment systems and from controlling how developers inform users about alternative payment methods.

If approved, the update would enable US users to view subscription pricing details and promotions directly in-app, purchase subscriptions via external links, seamlessly switch between Premium plans, and access payment options beyond Apple's system. Spotify suggested the update could eventually facilitate additional purchasing opportunities, including audiobooks. "While other governments around the world have taken steps against Apple's harmful practices, this is, by far, the most consequential action to date," Spotify said, calling it "absurd" that these "basic services" weren't permitted despite being ordered by a judge four years ago. Patreon has similarly announced [plans to submit an iOS app update](https://news.slashdot.org/story/25/05/01/2030224/patreon-will-update-its-iphone-app-to-sidestep-apples-payment-system) allowing creators to accept non-Apple payments.
