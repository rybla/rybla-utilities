# Waymo Says Its Driverless Cars Are Better Than Humans At Avoiding Crashes

An anonymous reader quotes a report from Teslarati: _Waymo Driver is already [reducing severe crashes](https://waymo.com/blog/2025/05/waymo-making-streets-safer-for-vru) and enhancing the safety of vulnerable road users. As per a new [research paper](https://storage.googleapis.com/waymo-uploads/files/documents/safety/Safety%20Impact%20Crash%20Type%20Manuscript.pdf) set for publication in the Traffic Injury Prevention Journal, Waymo Driver had [outperformed human drivers in safety](https://www.teslarati.com/robotaxis-are-already-making-roads-safer-waymo-report-reveals/), particularly for vulnerable road users (VRUs). Over 56.7 million miles, compared to human drivers, Waymo Driver achieved a 92% reduction in pedestrian injury crashes. It also saw 82% fewer crashes with injuries with cyclists and 82% fewer crashes with injuries with motorcyclists. Waymo Driver also slashed injury-involving intersection crashes by 96%, which are a leading cause of severe road harm for human drivers. Waymo Driver saw 85% fewer crashes with suspected serious or worse injuries as well._ "It's encouraging to see real-world data showing Waymo outperforming human drivers when it comes to safety. Fewer crashes and fewer injuries -- especially for people walking and biking -- is exactly the kind of progress we want to see from autonomous vehicles," said Jonathan Adkins, Chief Executive Officer at Governors Highway Safety Association.
