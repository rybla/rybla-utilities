    I've been busy packing for my first solo trip to Ireland, going to be doing Dublin 2 days, then using Galway as a homebase for the next 7 days. I'm super excited but pretty nervous as well. I think I have everything packed and ready though. Anyone have great spots in those two cities? I'll have a car rental for a few days in Galway so I can see the Cliffs of Moher and one of the Aran Islands, and might stop in a few close by towns. Otherwise, I'm not trying to plan too much, I just have a loose idea of what I'll be doing each day.

        Sounds great! Big endorsement for visiting Connemara and [The Wild Atlantic Way](https://www.thewildatlanticway.com/). My partner and I bike toured it in 2017 and it was incredible (though very windy and rainy :) ). There are great places you could rent a bike - if you're so inclined - and follow the route. Though be warned, we were told in Dublin that the saying from US General Sheridan "The only good indian is a dead one" has been changed to "the only good cyclist is a dead one" in Ireland. So keep that in mind if you cycle. It's fully worth it though.
        
        Near there, Letterfrack was pretty cool. And they have a great Hostel called the [Old Monastery](https://oldmonasteryhostel.com/) - that is as the name implies an old monastery. It's kind of spooky and haunted at night, but a great place to stay. There was also the most incredible mussels truck parked on the coast, just down the road - [though it looks like it's a crab spot now](https://maps.app.goo.gl/jDL4PrApoRtQqg6V9). The other fun things Galway-eans? do it ocean swimming. You can find folks to join at [Blackrock beach](https://g.co/kgs/VEjiKqC) or [Ladies Beach](https://g.co/kgs/X6oZhct).
        
        I hope you have a great trip!!!

            You are not the first person to suggest going swimming in Galway, which is really suprising to me, but so I think I pretty much have to at this point.
            
            These are all awesome suggestions, I'm very into spooky things, so I will definitely check out the Old Monastery. Thank you!!
