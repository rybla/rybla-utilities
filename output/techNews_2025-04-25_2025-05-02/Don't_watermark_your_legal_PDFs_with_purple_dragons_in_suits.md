# Don't watermark your legal PDFs with purple dragons in suits

Being a model citizen and a person of taste, you probably don't _need_ this reminder, but some others do: Federal judges do not like it when lawyers electronically watermark every page of their legal PDFs with a gigantic image—[purchased for $20 online](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/us/dragon-lawyer-lawsuit.html)—of a purple dragon wearing a suit and tie.

"Each page of plaintiff’s complaint appears on an e-filing which is dominated by a large multi-colored cartoon dragon dressed in a suit," he [wrote on April 28](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.miwd.114988/gov.uscourts.miwd.114988.6.0.pdf) (PDF). "Use of this dragon cartoon logo is not only distracting, it is juvenile and impertinent. The Court is not a cartoon."

Kent then ordered "that plaintiff shall not file any other documents with the cartoon dragon or other inappropriate content."
