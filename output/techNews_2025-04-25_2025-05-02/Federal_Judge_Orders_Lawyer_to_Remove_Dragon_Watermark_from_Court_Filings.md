# Federal Judge Orders Lawyer to Remove Dragon Watermark from Court Filings

A Michigan federal magistrate judge has banned a lawyer [from using a cartoon dragon watermark](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/05/dont-watermark-your-legal-pdfs-with-purple-dragons-in-suits/) on legal filings, [calling the practice "juvenile and impertinent."](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/us/dragon-lawyer-lawsuit.html) Judge Ray Kent of the Western District of Michigan issued the order on April 28 after receiving a complaint featuring a purple, suit-wearing dragon on every page.

"Each page of plaintiff's complaint appears on an e-filing which is dominated by a large multi-colored cartoon dragon dressed in a suit," Kent wrote. "The Court is not a cartoon." The watermark belongs to Jacob A. Perrone of Dragon Lawyers, who told The New York Times he purchased the image online for $20 because "people like dragons."

Perrone said it plans to continue using the logo in his practice but will tone it down in future court submissions.
