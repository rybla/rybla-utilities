# Polygon sold to GameRant owner Valnet

_Polygon_, _The Verge’s_ sister site dedicated to gaming and entertainment, has been sold by Vox Media to Valnet, a company that owns brands like _ScreenRant_, _GameRant_, and _Android Police_. Some _Polygon_ staffers will continue with the publication under its new owner, while others have been laid off, according to posts online and an internal message sent to Vox Media employees.

Valnet owns more than 27 different brands that cover areas like entertainment, gaming, sports, and travel. A recent report [from _TheWrap_](https://www.thewrap.com/valnet-labor-lawsuit-hassan-youssef-digital-media-sweat-shop/) includes one former contributor to a site under Valnet’s purview describing conditions as “almost sweatshop-level.”

“Perfectly aligned with Valnet’s long-term growth strategy, _Polygon_ will now integrate Valnet’s Gaming Portfolio, which includes industry-leading publications such as _Game Rant_, _TheGamer_, _Fextralife_, _OpenCritic_, _DualShockers_, and _HardcoreGamer_,” [the company said in a press release](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250501630767/en/Valnet-Acquires-Premium-Gaming-Publication-Polygon-from-Vox-Media). “This addition follows Valnet’s recent acquisition of _FextraLife_ earlier this year, further strengthening its position in the gaming media landscape. With Valnet’s proven operational excellence, _Polygon_ is poised to reach new editorial heights through focused investment and innovation.”

Vox Media CEO Jim Bankoff said in a statement that “this transaction will enable us to focus our energies and investment resources in other priority areas of growth across our portfolio of iconic digital publications and audio / video programming, while enabling Valnet to grow their leadership and authority in the gaming information category.” In his message to staff, Bankoff also cited the current “uncertain economic outlook” and broader changes in the gaming industry as contributing reasons to the sale.

“I’m no longer with Polygon,” says former [editor-in-chief Chris Plante](https://bsky.app/profile/plante.bsky.social/post/3lo4mn4noqc26). “If you’re hiring, please consider the many talented writers and editors now on the market. Every one of them deserves a spot on your staff. I won’t be talking more about the sale because I wasn’t involved.”
