I've been wanting to tell the Tildes community about a favorite podcast of mine, **The Film Reroll**, an improv. comedy show which plays through your favorite movies as TTRPGs and totally ruins them (their words, I love the show and think the cast is amazing), and would love to hear about any podcasts y'all listen to that you might want to recommend to others!

    **Behind the Bastards** is probably my favorite podcast. Basically, they talk about bad people. It started out with a lot of dictators and other very famous, very obviously bad people like Saddam, but as the show has gone on they’ve run out of dictators and now it’s kind of whoever. For example, scrolling through the last few months they’ve had episodes about P. Diddy, Oprah, Peter Thiel, as well as a bunch of people I’ve never heard of including the Zizians, Tony Alamo, and Bruno Bettelheim. The show in general features Robert Evans (usually) talking about the given bastard for the episode, usually starting at childhood and going through their life of bastardness, with a guest there, too.

    **A History of Rock Music in 500 Songs** ([https://500songs.com/](https://500songs.com/)) is my favourite podcast. It is nothing short of a magnum opus scale undertaking that has been moving chronologically through the history of English speaking popular music. Its focus is on rock, but in telling that story, it offers a much wider and more detailed look at a wider range of things that you might imagine from the title alone. Insanely well researched and presented.
    
    Another music podcast that I quite liked was **Wind of Change** ([https://crooked.com/podcast-series/wind-of-change/](https://crooked.com/podcast-series/wind-of-change/)), whose tagline "Did the CIA write a power ballad that ended the Cold War?" pretty much tells you everything that you need to know about it. If you nostalgically remember the song and love mystery and spy stuff, it's worth a listen. A couple of other investigative podcasts in a slightly similar style would be **Finding Drago** ([https://www.abc.net.au/listen/programs/finding-drago](https://www.abc.net.au/listen/programs/finding-drago)) which is about a mysterious author and **The Polybius Conspiracy** ([https://www.radiotopia.fm/showcase/the-polybius-conspiracy](https://www.radiotopia.fm/showcase/the-polybius-conspiracy)) which is about the claim that a strange early-80s arcade machine was designed to manipulate its players. If you happen to like any of these and have recommendations for something similar, I'm all ears!
    
    **The Rest Is History** ([https://therestishistory.com/episodes/](https://therestishistory.com/episodes/)) is my favourite general history podcast. It strikes a perfect balance between interesting information and light hearted presentation. Not all of the topics interest me, but more often than not, topics that I didn't think would be interesting ended up being really fascinating. If you want a good starting point, their 8-part series on the fall of the Aztecs (episodes 384-391) was absolutely brilliant.
    
    Another podcast that combines comedy and information, this one leaning more towards comedy, is **No Such Thing As A Fish** ([https://www.nosuchthingasafish.com/](https://www.nosuchthingasafish.com/)). If you know the BBC panel show QI, it's quite similar in tone. Which is not surprising, given that the podcast is run by QI researchers.
    
    **History of Philosophy** ([https://historyofphilosophy.net/](https://historyofphilosophy.net/)) is actually two podcasts. One concentrates on diving deep into the history of western philosophy, while the other has by now done almost 200 episodes on the history of classical philosophy in India, Africa and now more recently China. It's this latter podcast that I'm particularly fond of, as I'm less familiar with those traditions.

    **The Lazarus Heist**: Investigations into North Korean hacking operations. Super interesting, highly recommend!
    
    **99% Invisible**: About architecture and other design in our built environment. Very approachable for a layperson. I'm not at all an architect or designer and I find it super interesting.
    
    **Radiolab**: I especially liked the period with Jad Abumrad and Robert Krulwich. It's quite broad, with a focus on science, but all kinds of interesting topics. If you want to start then I recommend the episode "Patient Zero". It's my favourite and just objectively good, in my subjective opinion :D
    
    **American Scandal**: From Watergate to Muhammed Ali to Theranos to the Challenger Disaster. A few episodes on each topic, partially dramatised.
    
    **British Scandal**: Same as above but for the UK. Presented by two people in a more comedic tone than American Scandal. I appreciate both, the hosts of British Scandal are genuinely funny and have great banter.
    
    **Cautionary Tales**: Stories about historical events where things went (terribly) wrong for some reason and the lessons we can learn from it.
    
    **Darknet Diaries**: Describes itself as exploring "the dark side of the internet", with stories of hacking, data breaches, and cybercrime. But a lot of it also isn't that dark. Some of my favourite episodes involve pen testers telling their stories.
    
    **Intrigue**: From the BBC, like 7 episodes half hour episodes per topic. Easiest to just look at what it's about and see if you like it.
    
    **Kill List**: Crazy investigation into murder for hire on the internet.
    
    **Legacy**: Two hosts who look at historical figures and discuss their lives and how we look at them today. Very interesting, about 4 hour long episodes per person.
    
    **More or Less: Behind the Stats**: Investigations, some short and some long, about statistics in the news and in life. For example: "How did lock impact children?" (longer episode) or "Has the US sent $50 million worth of condoms in Gaza?" (shorter episode, the answer is no obviously but they investigate where this crazy claim came from).
    
    **The Missing Cryptoqueen**: Investigation into Ruja Ignatova and her OneCoin cryptocurrency scam.
    
    **Uncharted with Hannah Fry**: Stories about how data and mathematical patterns shape our world.

        the pen testing episodes of Darknet Diaries are the best! I can't stand how Jack chirps in to recap / summarize things, though... as if any of it is surprising. Good list!

    As a middle aged white dude, I believe it is my contractual obligation to mention **Stuff You Should Know** which is a podcast by two other middle aged white dudes who do shallow dives on disparate topics. They are fun and spread knowledge around.
    
    **Conan O'Brien Needs a Friend** (daringtodayarentwe.png) is another that is often funny, but can also be surprisingly heartfelt and kind. Conan O'Brien hosts and brings on a friend, which is often a celebrity, but sometimes not.

    *   The Quillette Podcast ([https://quillette.com/tag/podcast/](https://quillette.com/tag/podcast/)) is a moderate center-right political podcast
        
    *   Sam Harris's Making Sense ([https://www.samharris.org/podcasts](https://www.samharris.org/podcasts)) talks about meditation, the mind, politics (mostly centrist). His opposition to Trump has been thankfully consistent (as opposed to some other "centrist" podcasters) and his anti-Trump rants can be refreshingly cathartic.
        
    *   Decoding the Gurus ([https://decoding-the-gurus.captivate.fm/](https://decoding-the-gurus.captivate.fm/)) -- two academics cover modern gurus. Politically center/left I think

    *   This Developer's Life ([https://thisdeveloperslife.com/](https://thisdeveloperslife.com/)) is the best software development -related podcast I've ever listened to. By a Microsoft developer Scott Hanselman. Philosophical more than technical, sort of. Styled after This American Life. Ran between 2010-2015 but still relevant due mostly not being about the technology.

    As far as actual play D&D podcasts I really enjoyed the first season of _The Adventure Zone_, although I did not listen to the later seasons they did after the conclusion of Taako, Merle, and Magnus's adventures. I also liked _Not Another D&D Podcast_, Campaign 1, although I fell off part way through Campaign 2. I've listened to the podcast versions of _Critical Role_, but I find it hard to keep track of so many characters without seeing them on screen so I never actually finished.
    
    I've found I enjoy more intentionally produced, written, and voice acted podcasts more than actual play podcasts. I love the DnD theme (sort of medieval high fantasy LOTR-esque or Skyrim-esque stories) but I haven't found many that scratch that itch. Instead, I've kind of gone down the mystery/horror genre to some extent.
    
    Anyway, here ya go:
    
    *   Limetown
    *   Malevolent
    *   The Magnus Archives
    *   The Lovecraft Investigations
    *   Old Gods of Appalachia
    
    I know there are more, but I can't think of them at the moment.  
    I find my surroundings impact my listening a lot. 99% of the time I listen to them in the evenings or at night while I'm walking my dog on a trail out the back of our neighborhood, or sometimes on a lounge chair in the back yard. Being in the woods late in the day or at night has a big impact on making surreal, mystery, horror, supernatural type listening more impactful. I'd recommend it!

        I think it's still great and worth a listen. After that though don't bother. They never were able to get back to that level and just continued going off the deep end of terrible weird shit. I stopped listening after a few more series cause I couldn't stand it anymore and they lost all the magic they had in Balance.
        
        Balance is the best thing they ever did.

    There was [thread](https://tildes.net/~talk/1n4t/recommended_podcasts_by_experts_in_their_fields) a while ago about podcasts by those who are experts in their fields, and it had some good recommendations, so definitely check those out in addition to all the ones here!
    
    I'll post the same comment I left there, since I really love the three podcasts that I mentioned:
    
    > I really enjoy the BBC's [**In Our Time**](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qykl) podcast. Each episode focuses on a different topic and the host will talk to and interview 3 experts (all usually professors or academics in some way). Topics range from everything from antiquity to science to literature. So one episode might be about a particular dinosaur and the 3 experts will be paleontologists and a museum curator at a natural history museum, then another episode might be about _The Odyssey_ and the three experts will be historians and literature professors. Whenever there's an episode about something relating to my specific background, I've actually recognized one or two of the experts they've had on (probably because I read some of their books in grad school). So in terms of accuracy and depth it's a hard podcast to beat. My only downside to it is that some episodes/topics as well as some of the experts can be a bit dry (which it does not sound like you mind), but since each episode is a different topic and has different experts, you can just skip to a new episode that interests you and hopefully enjoy it more. I've learned all sorts of random stuff about topics I would have never thought to seek out.
    > 
    > Also, not 100% what you asked for, since he technically is not an expert and there are definitely ads at the beginning of each episode (which are consistent and therefore easy to skip depending on your podcast player), but I really enjoyed the **History of Rome** and the **Revolutions** podcasts, both by Mike Duncan. He's not technically an expert, but the amount of research he did for each episode is commendable, and he does a good job of conveying complicated histories to the average listener while keeping a relatable and level-headed take on things (like he'll clearly point out when evidence is lacking for certain things, or that sources differ on this particular event that may or may not have happened).

    I listen to science podcasts mainly but not exclusively. I'm posting very short descriptions which don't do these justice but it's what I have capacity for at the moment.
    
    *   **The Skeptics Guide to the Universe:** They're about to celebrate 20 years, they are good and consistent, I've been listening to them for ages and they have not missed an episode (it's weekly). They mostly discuss science news items but also explore topics related to skepticism.
    *   **The Supermassive Podcast:** A team of physicists and a journalist explore topics related to astrophysics. They also feature interviews with experts about said topics.
    *   **Art of the Score:** A group of very skilled musicians review soundtracks (Mainly movies). As someone who knows nothing of music theory it's been very accessible and interesting.
    *   **The Infinite Monkey Cage:** A physicist and a comedian ask a panel of expert questions about a topic, usually science. There's also a comedian in the panel which makes it entertaining.
    *   **Hello From the Magic Tavern:** Since you mentioned an improv podcast I think this one may be one you'd enjoy. It's three regular hosts and a guest, they are in a fantasy world and in good improv fashion make up everything as they go.

    Building Up Resilience is an offshoot podcast from the guys that did Breaking Down: Collapse
    
    Breaking Down: Collapse discusses the science behind the catabolic collapse of civilizations and they talk about everything from the Roman Empire to the Soviet Union. It actually has brought me a lot of comfort to know generally how it has worked in the past and how people have made it through. The basis is that collapse generally doesn’t happen over night, you lose access to the things you use daily very slowly - internet and electricity get spotty, gas food and medical supplies become more expensive. Finally, people become displaced when the war reaches them, they immigrate just like our ancestors have many times and we start over, we build a new society.
    
    Building Up Resilience is about how to prepare yourself for things like losing access to electricity, water, internet, transportation, food, etc. They also dive into how to prepare yourself mentally and physically, how to be mentally strong, physically ready, and how important your community is in a time of need like a natural disaster. They don’t say it, but I think the idea is that you want to position yourself in a way so that you can help rebuild when the time comes.

    [Kill James Bond](https://www.killjamesbond.com/). Abigail Thorne (aka [Philosophy Tube](https://www.youtube.com/@PhilosophyTube), also an actor in Stuff You've Heard Of) and friends discuss each Bond movie in chronological order. Has made me laugh out loud on multiple occasions. Yes, "Bond is awful" is fish in a barrel stuff but the presenters are clearly good friends and smart people, having fun.
    
    [Let's Learn Everything](https://www.letslearneverything.com/). Good friends and smart people having fun, again. Each of the three presenters covers a different topic in well-researched detail, the gimmick is that the other presenters don't know what the topic is until time of recording. So far topics such as "bees" (fuck me, bees are so much more amazing than I thought they were) and "what is the median size thing?" have stood out for me. Some might find the presentation style a little... enthusiastic. I can't listen to too many of these back to back, but the enthusiasm does seem genuine and the topics are interesting and that makes it work, for me at least.
    
    [Answer Me This](https://answermethispodcast.com/) - first launched in _2007_, this venerable podcast has been off-air for the last few years before a surprise return a couple of months ago. Cozy, friendly, but well-informed and entertaining, it's the original "interesting facts and listener questions" podcast. Good friends and smart people, having fun. I'm noticing a pattern in the things I like..

    *   [The Recipe with Kenji and Deb](https://www.therecipepodcast.com/) is Kenji (SE, NYT, etc) and Deb (SmittenKitchen) -- they tackle one food per episode and discuss various recipes, techniques, etc. Its all very light and fun.
    *   [Oxley Bom MotoGP Podcast](https://oxleybom.buzzsprout.com/) -- Mat Oxley and Peter Bom cover MotoGP. Oxley is a freelance journalist and Bom is a former crew chief and data recording engineer.
    *   [This American Life](https://thisamericanlife.org/) -- a standard.
    *   [Lakers Film Room Podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/laker-film-room-dedicated-to-the-study-of-lakers-basketball/id1187085559) -- a great breakdown on the weakness of zone defence.

    Here's one of my favorites that hasn't been mentioned yet: [That's Absurd Please Elaborate](https://thatsabsurdshow.com/) is hosted by a couple pretty funny science communicators (and sometimes guests) where they each pick an absurd question, either posed by the other host or more often listener submissions, and then do a crazy amount of research to answer them in the most detailed and scientifically accurate way possible. Listening from the beginning is very rewarding because they've built a cadre of recurring in-jokes.
    
    Some of the questions they've answered are things like "1 trillion lions versus the sun, who would win?" and "Does my poop reach terminal velocity when I flush from the top of a skyscraper?" or "How long would it have taken Westley in The Princess Bride to develop an immunity to iocane powder?" (that last one has a great twist ending). It's one of those ones that gets me funny looks when I listen in public because I'm always laughing out loud.
    
    Bonus: If you already subscribe to Nebula you can get this one ad-free.

    I like to look for small podcasts that are very niche or specific to whatever I'm interested in at the moment.
    
    I've gotten in the habit of watching old TV shows, especially ones from the 1970s. Most recently I've been watching [The Rockford Files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rockford_Files). It's a very good show with excellent writing and acting, and has a lot of guest stars that you will recognize from other old shows and movies. It has that in common with Columbo but has way more episodes.
    
    Anyway, when watching an old show I think it's fun to find a podcast that has discussions about the show. I think [Two Hundred a Day](https://twohundredaday.fireside.fm/) is pretty good. They hosts are good at pointing out the inside jokes and tropes in the episode, but they do miss some of the 1970's details since they are younger than the show. At least in the early episodes, they talk about how the storytelling techniques used in the show can be applied to game design or game scenarios.
    
    It seems like their last episode is from November 2024 so maybe they stopped making new ones. But they do have 147 episodes.

    It's relatively niche (_Magic: the Gathering_, specifically the Commander format), but it's the only podcast I listen to: **The Howling Salt Mine.**
    
    A group of friends who collect stories of salty (in the vein of, "upset when something doesn't go your way in a game") interactions at Magic tables across the world, read them out, and comment on them.
    
    My description doesn't do it justice at all. The hosts are really fun to listen to, the stories are funny, and I get lots of deckbuilding ideas and strategy tips from it. If you're into Commander at all, it's really worth a listen.

    I really don't watch/listen to many podcasts, but the one I do tune in for every week is [**The Deep 3**](https://www.youtube.com/@thedeep3pod), which is an excellent basketball podcast (I linked to youtube because I watch them every week, but they're also on spotify/apple/etc.). They have a good mix of long form, in depth discussion in the first half of each episode as well as shorter form, lighter content like tier lists and off the cuff player comparisons in the second half. There are some good jokes here and there and they also often touch on the intersections of basketball and culture (though not necessarily in a deep way). It's nice and light hearted and fun while also having some great analysis of the game. These dudes know ball and I would much, much, much rather listen to them than any basketball "analysis" found on TNT, ESPN, etc. They certainly aren't the only basketball analysts I watch on youtube, though they would be the only ones that fall under podcast territory.

    My favorite podcast is probably Science Friday, which invites scientists to talk about their work, frequently on topics that have been in the news recently. News articles tend to sensationalize or misrepresent scientific research, so it's great to hear about things directly from the source.
    
    I also like Planet Money, an NPR podcast about economics. They also frequently have economists or other experts on. I feel like news reporting on economics is often so politically charged that it's hard to trust normal news articles. Hearing from experts is a bit better. I know these kinds of people write articles too, but it's more digestible in podcast form, especially while doing menial work.
    
    When I have some extra time, I like listening to Wait Wait Don't Tell Me, which is a comedy news quiz show on NPR. I feel like I'm getting slightly informed on current events, but it's mostly about the jokes from the host and guest comedians.
    
    One other thing I've been doing lately is using google's notebooklm to generate podcasts for me. I'll feed it a scientific paper or a chapter from a textbook, and it's able to generate a reasonably realistic sounding podcast discussing the topic at a high level.

    **Nerd Poker** - Favorite D&D campaign podcast. It's Brian Posehn and some friends playing reasonably decent D&D, probably usually pretty high. Season 3 (Cloddenheim) is a good place to start.
    
    **Dispel Magic** - Favorite D&D discussion podcast. They take magic spells and creatures and extend the logic into a society that has sort of reached an industrial age of magic, e.g. factories of wizards producing Magic Mouth-imbued items to create audiobooks, etc. It's a fun podcast. They aren't always RAW, exactly, but I've nabbed a few ideas from them
    
    **Philosophize This** - Favorite philosophy podcast. Goes through the history of Western thought in an approachable way. He made a pivot a year, maybe two, ago, where he started getting a bit more contemporary and introduced me to some philosophers I've been enjoying since (Susan Sontag, Byung Chul Han, others). The podcasts are short, go very fast, but leave me with an impression.
    
    Runners up - Dungeon Masters of None (D&D), Very Bad Wizards (philosophy)

        Very Bad Wizards is probably my #1 most-anticipated-new-episodes podcast right now, but I have a lot of interests that align with the hosts (all things Lynchian, Star Trek comes up a lot, a disdain for generative AI, weird fiction, the list goes on). Their Patreon bonus episodes are pretty great too (did an episode-by-episode breakdown of Deadwood, followed by the same for Severence, and next going to do a series on film noir).

    I don’t listen to many podcasts, but I started recently because I need a daily dose of comedy in my life, especially when I am busy and exhausted. Podcasts seem good for that. The only one I am really listening to lately is **Bad Friends** with Bobby Lee and Andrew Santino. It is a comedy podcast that sometimes has other comedians on. Silly and outrageous. Probably not for everyone, but it scratches an itch for me that is hard to describe. It makes me feel close to my childhood friends and our childhood spent together.
    
    If anyone is looking for something exotic, there is [this podcast that consists of episodes from a 90s Korean radio show whose host died tragically in 2004](https://podcasts.apple.com/kr/podcast/%EC%A0%95%EC%9D%80%EC%9E%84%EC%9D%98-fm%EC%98%81%ED%99%94%EC%9D%8C%EC%95%85-%ED%8C%9F%EC%BA%90%EC%8A%A4%ED%8A%B8/id409716345). It has all the commercials from the time and feels like a blast from the past. They play a wide variety of music from around the world and talk about film (in Korean).

    The other podcast I was gonna mention is on the list, so here are the other two I listen to as soon as new episodes happen:
    
    **The Off-Menu Podcast** ([https://www.offmenupodcast.co.uk/](https://www.offmenupodcast.co.uk/) )
    
    Two comedians invite a celebrity guest and ask them their favourite dream menu items. It gets funny, sometimes serious, sometimes deep or nostalgic... I think I've only disliked two episodes ever.
    
    **The Taskmaster Podcast** ( [https://www.taskmaster.tv/podcast](https://www.taskmaster.tv/podcast) ). It's very much based on the show, so if you're not watching the show you'll be lost, but if you are, it a nice way to get more taskmaster after you've seen it all
