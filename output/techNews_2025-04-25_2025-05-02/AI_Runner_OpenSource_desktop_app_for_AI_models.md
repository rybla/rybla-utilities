[AI Runner](https://github.com/Capsize-Games/airunner) is a desktop application for Linux and Windows that allows you to easily streamline AI workflows, use RAG on your own private data, have conversations with offline chatbots, and generate AI art and videos from images for free.

It uses a permissive Apache 2 license and can be easily extended to create your own applications.

This is one of the few desktop applications (perhaps the only) to offer a multi-modal experience to non-technical users as they are able to [download a packaged version from itch.io](https://capsizegames.itch.io/ai-runner) and run a setup wizard to get up and running without any technical barriers.

[Take a look at my Github repo](https://github.com/Capsize-Games/airunner) and let me know what you think. And if you like what you see, be sure to leave me a star to support the project.
