# Tabarrok on the Not My Generation Podcast

Political Scientists James Davenport and Craig Dawkins [interview me on everything from tariffs to the Borda Count](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1vPS1lvIpUmXFln2p3UJX9). Here is one bit I wish to underline:

> Q. In your opinion, what is the biggest economic myth or misconception that is holding the U.S. back?
> 
> What worries me most is that we’re treating China like an enemy—and that mindset risks becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy. What I want people to understand is this: we have a lot to gain from a rich China.
> 
> In my 2009 TED Talk, I gave one of my favorite examples. As China grows wealthier, it invests more in thinking—research, science, and development—that benefits the entire world. Richer countries face diseases of aging, not poverty. As China shifts its focus to diseases like cancer, it ramps up investment in drug development. That raises the odds of a cure—something worth trillions to humanity. If an American cured cancer, I’d be thrilled. If a Chinese citizen cured cancer, I’d be 99.9% as thrilled.
> 
> Yes, China is not a democracy. But by global standards, it hasn’t been especially militaristic. There have been border disputes, but no major invasions in over 50 years. China isn’t sending troops to the Middle East or Latin America.
> 
> That could change. But nothing inescapable says the U.S. and China must be enemies. We have far more to gain from peace, trade, and prosperity than from conflict.
