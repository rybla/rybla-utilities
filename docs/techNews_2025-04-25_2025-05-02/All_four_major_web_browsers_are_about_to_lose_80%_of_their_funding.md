Four major web browsers dominate the market: Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, and Apple’s Safari. What most users don’t realize is that Google effectively bankrolls over 80% of the development for _all_ of them. But this funding stream is under threat: the US Department of Justice is moving to force Google to cut off its competitors and divest from Chrome, a decision that will simultaneously cripple the development of every major browser.

## Google directly pays 80%+ of Mozilla and Safari’s budget

Google pays Mozilla and Apple to make Google Search the default search engine for Firefox and Safari. [Google pays Apple about $18 billion each year](https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/26/23933206/google-apple-search-deal-safari-18-billion), and pays Mozilla about $450 million each year.

[“In 2021 these payments accounted for 83% of Mozilla’s revenue.”](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-05-05/why-google-keeps-paying-mozilla-s-firefox-even-as-chrome-dominates)

Apple doesn’t disclose how much they spend on Safari specifically, but [Apple’s total R&D across all its products (iPhones, Macs, etc.) was nearly $30 billion in 2023](https://straitsresearch.com/statistic/apple-surpasses-earnings-forecasts#:~:text=Furthermore%2C%20The%20company's%20growing%20expenditures,%2426.42%20billion%20in%20FY%202022.). Google’s $18 billion payment specifically for search placement represents a staggering 60% of that total budget. The portion Apple spends just on Safari development is undoubtedly far smaller, meaning Google’s payment likely covers a vast majority of Safari’s specific development costs.

## Microsoft Edge is just a Microsoft-branded version of Google Chrome

[Microsoft Edge is actually a “white label” copy of Google Chrome](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge/learning-center/what-is-chromium-how-does-it-enhance-your-browser?form=MA13I2), specifically the open-source “Chromium” browser that Google maintains.

Now, to be fair, Microsoft isn’t _just_ copying Chrome; they also contribute code back to Chromium. But Microsoft contributes much, much less than Google does.

[“In 2024, Google made over 100,000 commits to Chromium, accounting for ~94 percent of contributions.”](https://blog.chromium.org/2025/01/announcing-supporters-of-chromium-based.html)

## Most of the funding for all of the major browsers is going away

The US Department of Justice has argued that Google should be forbidden from making search-engine deals with Mozilla and Apple.

Mozilla and Apple have argued against this.

*   [Mozilla: The DOJ’s proposal hurts, not helps, browser competition](https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/internet-policy/proposed-remedies-browsers/)

And [the DoJ has also argued that Google should be forced to sell off Chrome](https://www.npr.org/2025/04/21/nx-s1-5369404/google-doj-opening-statements-remedies-trial#:~:text=What%20were%20the%20DOJ's%20arguments,revenue%20for%20Google%2C%20Dahlquist%20said.), forbidding Google from paying for Chrome and Chromium. Microsoft Edge will lose 94% of its funding when that happens.

## Google’s probably going to lose, and the web will be in pretty big trouble when Google gets what’s coming to them

The DoJ’s argument against Google makes perfect sense. The Sherman Antitrust Act was specifically designed to target “competitors” who form illegal agreements to maintain monopoly power.

It’s _obviously_ illegal for Google to prop up Mozilla Firefox and Apple Safari as if they were co-equal competitors to Chrome. And Chrome itself is the biggest “search-engine deal” of all, which is why the DoJ is so focused on forcing Google to divest from Chrome.

It just so happens that all four of the major web browsers will lose all of their funding all at once when that happens.

Forcing Google to stop funding its “competitors” and divest Chrome doesn’t just punish Google; it simultaneously pulls the financial rug out from under _every single major browser,_ including those positioned as alternatives.

The laws intended to foster competition will inadvertently destabilize the foundational tools millions rely on to access the internet.
