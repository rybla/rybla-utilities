# Offbeat Fridays â€“ The thread where offbeat headlines become front page news

9 votes

Tildes is a very serious site, where we discuss very serious matters like [blackouts](https://tildes.net/?tag=blackouts), [misconceptions](https://tildes.net/?tag=misconceptions) and [epic games v apple](https://tildes.net/?tag=epic_games_v_apple). Tags culled from the highest voted topics from the last seven days, if anyone was hawk-eyed.

But one of my favourite tags happens to be [offbeat](https://tildes.net/?tag=offbeat)! Taking its original inspiration from [Sir Nils Olav III](https://tildes.net/~life/19m8/the_highest_ranking_penguin_in_the_world_sir_nils_olav_iii_has_been_promoted_to_major_general_by), this thread is looking for any far-fetched `offbeat` stories lurking in the newspapers. It may not deserve its own post, but it deserves a wider audience!
