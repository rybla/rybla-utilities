    My dad died a couple weeks ago. It's a lot. He wasn't that old, but his health has been failing over the last 15 years. My feelings about it are very complicated, which makes sense seeing as our relationship was complicated. All things said and done, I loved my father, and I know he truly loved me.

        I feel for you. My mom died 5 years ago tomorrow, and I'm still trying to work it out in my head. I really hope you can be extra kind to yourself and give yourself lots of time.

            Thank you. Its such a massive life mark without words. And noone has the words, which is simply apropos. What was your mom like?

        I do get what you mean about complicated relationships, it can be hard to unpack yourself and just as hard to talk ill to others about someone you're grieving.

    Just really getting it to me that I'm still living with my parents, and never had a relationship... It's not as bad as when I did not have a job but it's still like watching my life pass me by at times. Not much irl contacts at this moment either, and I wish I lived somewhere in a city. It just... Suits me more.
    
    Then there is the resurgence of fascism and stuff. Y'know, the minor details. _sigh_

        As someone who lived with parents on more than one occasion as an adult, I know this is a cliche and I'm sure you've heard it many times but stay strong and keep trying (to date). It may be difficult and having people turn you down because you live with parents hurts, just keep trying. Eventually you'll find someone who doesn't care that you live with your parents and that person will want to date you. And eventually when you get your own place and move out, and when you start dating, don't discriminate against those who live with parents.

        In my city its still possible to move into an apartment and split the rent between two or three room mates. Not sure how your city is. Theres services for finding room mates too like they’ll do background checks for you and everything. Friend of mine did that quite a few times about ten years ago.
        
        I was just really broke for a long time cause I didn’t want to live with my parents. A lot of the time I wasn’t even on the lease of the place where I was staying. Rent is pretty cheap when you squeeze 5 people into a 3 bedroom. I was so broke after paying the $300 rent though that Id go days without food.
        
        I think a lot of people start out on their own like that, just really really broke. I definitely could have had a better standard of living if I had stayed at my moms house but I don’t regret it, I learned a lot and met a lot of people.

    Not great. I work as QA Mgr at a food processing facility and for the last two days we're in the middle of an investigation that will determine whether we will initiate a product recall. The main issue is we have very little information about the scope of the issue. Does not feel good.

    It was very bad at first. But I saw my psychiatrist and I got 12 hour long stimulants and I've slowly been getting better. Being able to get up.. Kind of.
    
    My mood is slowly getting better. I think.
    
    But now I'm suffering from dry mouth. My gums are bleeding and my tongue is also sort of not great.
    
    Time to see the doc again.

    [April mood chart](https://i.ibb.co/qMPg6Fg9/image.png)
    
    Some good days here and there, most of them bad to awful, a couple of them worse than in a very long time. Had a one two punch of two separate conflicts with two friends over easter that made me think it would all fall, and by extension my life being ruined because these few friends is one of the only good things in my life. Some of this stuff was legitimate to be upset about, but most of it was just mental illness.. triggers everywhere, mind seeing things that weren't there, perceiving abandonment that wasn't happening, distorting facts.. as a result I've just been feeling like a bad person for weeks now, more so than I usually do. Still the tiniest things make me spiral. 1 word in 1 sentence out of 100 is enough to somehow make me believe that that 1 thing is the truth and not the 99 other things. Just grabbing that and holding on to it and not hearing the rest.
    
    I try to distract myself to cope but I'm losing my balance and feel like I'm going to fall apart the next time anything remotely major happens. Fighting against thought of self harm and worse is also harder than it has been in many months. I have still refrained though for 219 days. I've been able to feel proud about it before but nowadays it doesn't feel like a win at all. Feels like since I got my tattoo over most of the scars on my arm, cutting wouldn't just be an unhealthy coping method, but a thing that would cause me to break even further because this art is a symbol of trying to get better. So relapsing would be so much worse than in the past, it seems.
    
    So yeah.. just hanging in there.
    
    Friend sent me [this](https://www.instagram.com/p/DI4yBrfPKGN/) and it resonated a lot.

    Been unemployed for 8 weeks now. I'm in grad school and tuition has tanked my savings, so it's really bad timing. I started an LLC, and got a 6 month contract at about 60% of my previous salary starting later this month. But I still won't have health insurance (COBRA was $2,000 a month) and I was supposed to have an MRI on my knee. The state's unemployment division did side with me vs my former employer that my termination was not "for cause" and I'm eligible for unemployment benefits, so the mortgage will continue to be paid. I'm volunteering today with some neighbors for highway cleanup, maybe some of them will have job leads. So it's a mixed bag.
    
    I was the "gifted kid" on a full ride to a prestigious business school. I really thought I'd be a wealthy C-Suite executive by my mid-30's. Instead I'm unemployed and trying to restart my career in a completely different field. Feel like I've wasted 15 years.

    I've been struggling a ton.
    
    I'm in the US, and I hate being so informed all the time of all the ways life is going to be shit in new and interesting ways. And I was not at all ready for the... everything. Spent all my savings getting to an area that's safer for me, so I have no padding if I lose my job. Don't have a robust support system. Also, I hate my job and I feel like it's killing me, to the point I'm trying to leave tech altogether. It's just all too much to deal with right now.
    
    But, I started practicing piano more consistently, and I'm taking my medication on time. I'm slowly picking up the pieces, slowly feeling better about myself. So it's a struggle, but I'm getting through it I think. For now.

    Adapting to my recently and late-diagnosed autism is kicking my ass.
    
    I'm glad to have (finally, it seems) found the missing puzzle piece that explains why my life has generally been mostly a series of missteps and tragedies.
    
    I was never built for this conformist world.
    
    I've barely been in public spaces for 2 months apart from cycling on public trails Ever time I have been in an indoor public space, I'm confronted by painful noises, distracting visuals, and early warning signs of implosive meltdowns.
    
    I recently visited the in-laws for my father-in-law's heart surgery. I got to experience a number of allistic invalidations and judgement of my experience. It was as though my dignity and pain just didn't matter.
    
    Of course, they have no idea how hard it has been to succeed in this society for 49 years, while suffering constantly for no clear reason (until now) and still presenting as a mildly mental person or as a person insisting on doing the morally/ethically right thing even when inconvenient for me or for more employer—and why I'm so burnt out that I haven't worked in 2 years.
    
    FiL bluntly asking if I've considered going on Social Security Disability (which, by the way, is an utterly humiliating and frustrating process, from prior experience with my late Huntington's Diseased wife). SisterIL initiated an interrogation about how I'm dealing with my autism, leading up to her saying, "Well, everyone has their own pain". Neither of them meant to do harm yet their remarks were so absurdly lacking empathy.
    
    I finally snapped and told her that she has no idea how much that hurt, that I'm tired of casual denigration—particularly from family, and to either lean in or just don't ask about my experience.
    
    The worst part of a late autism diagnosis is the emotional labor that almost every allistic implicitly expects me to do for them. Masking just leads to more anxiety while showing up authentically isn't necessarily better. I don't have the spoons to teach them about autism so my take, after two months, has slowly moved toward asking and just starting to advocate for my needs and that if people expect me to educate them that they should "do your own research of fuck off."

    I'm in a fucking bad mood.
    
    A recap for those who haven't been following my situation: I'm in the process of purchasing a flat and had my offer accepted back in October, but it now looks like this is going to fall through. I was made redundant a few weeks ago because my previous employer are a bunch of greedy fucks who have responded to a decline in sales with mass layoffs, my mortgage offer expires very soon, and this whole process has been dragged out because the property is in negative equity due to owed ground rent, council bills and some care costs (prev leaseholder passed away.)
    
    The job search is going dreadfully. I've had a grand total of five interviews since being laid off. Three rejections, one company closing the position without the decency of even giving me any interview feedback, and another dragging their heels with delaying the second stage interview. Whereas three years ago I was constantly being pigeonholed into shitty purchase ledger jobs now, I'm now in a market that wants nothing to do with me.
    
    Woken up this morning with feedback from an interview I had yesterday, and the criticism I received was rather harsh, basically they had reservations about my communication skills and how I handled an hour long competency based interview. Gotta love having Asperger's. I mean I didn't disclose it nor asked for any reasonable adjustments because I think that would have felt like cheating, but it still makes me feel mentally handicapped.
