# Show HN: Exhibit and Site on Mechanisms for Students

![](https://mechanical-library.org/img/site/homepage_diagram.jpg)

The Mechanical Library is an open-source exhibit and curriculum to introduce mechanical engineering to middle and high school student. The 6-foot-tall exhibit of moving mechanical models demonstrate important or interesting engineering inventions. Each mechanism has a web page that explains how the mechanisms are used in real life. It has photos, videos, 3D models, & lego models.

We hope to support STEM education by sparking curiosity in how things work. [Learn more about the project](#About)

The Mechanical Library is being built by [Steve Turbek](https://www.turbek.com/). Mechanical Library is a non-commercial labor of love, with support by [NYCFirst](https://www.nycfirst.org/), who provides meaningful and joyful STEM and robotics programming to NYC public school students.

The Mechanical Library is inspired by the 1920's "Mechanical Wonderland" museum exhibit by W.M. Clark, which was inspired by the book "507 Mechanical Movements" by Henry T. Brown. [Here is our custom research into the history of the exhibits](https://mechanical-library.org/mechanical-wonderland.html). More [research and sources](https://mechanical-library.org/research.html).

### Mechanical Library Project Goals

The Mechanical Library is inspired by great science and engineering teachers worldwide.

1.  Inspire the 'engineering mindset' in middle to high school students, especially those not excited by math and engineering.
2.  Make something interesting for kids and parents to introduce Mechanical Engineering using practical demonstrations.
3.  Communicate the opportunities for a career in the well-paid physical technical fields.
4.  Support teachers who cover these subjects.
