    I'm working on Elder Race for tildes book club. At this point my participation is kind of treating this like it's a suggested reading list due to other time constraints, but dang it if I'm not giving it a shot! This one is so nice and short.
    
    I've been reading Narnia on my phone while in transit. Currently on The Silver Chair, with The Last Battle remaining. This will be my first read through of all of them (Narnian chronology) and I'm completely in the dark as to the events of these last two books. They're fun, though there are certainly places where you catch the Christian imagery and symbolism. They can be a little overbearingly juvenile at times, though, and that's usually when I take a break.
    
    Continuing with my listen of the Witcher series. Currently on Tower of Swallows. I could take it or leave it. Next up is Happy Place by Emily Henry and Go Tell the Bees That I Am Gone by Diana Gabaldon; after that... whatever shows up from hold first?
    
    My partner and I have been attempting to listen to the Murderbot Diaries. Currently on Rogue Protocol, but it's about to return itself because we're moving and haven't been settled for a listen.

    Recently have been enjoying some of Samuel Beckett's short fiction! Particularly the stories "First Love", "The Expelled", "The Calmative", and "The End". These stories all share a similar or the same narrator, sort of a vagrant who tends to mainly have the goal of staying indoors somewhere. These stories have a very interesting perspective and a lot of humor in them. I've previously seen Waiting for Godot, and I plan to check out his novels soon.
    
    I'm about halfway through Pynchon's _V._ so far I am enjoying the Stencil segments a lot more than the stuff focusing on Benny Profane. I am close to done but not quite with the Kurt Mondaugen segment, which a lot hold as the best part of the novel. Having read _Gravity's Rainbow_, the connections to that make it particularly appealing. Overall I can tell it's his first novel and seems kind of rough around the edges, but it's still Pynchon!

    I decided to give romantasy a chance because I liked the idea of the storyline of the series I decided to read. I read Hades X Persephone and boy do I regret it. The 7th book blew up everything I enjoyed about the series and left so many open ends. It made me furious.
    
    So I started We Shall Be Monsters by Alyssa Wees, and am about halfway through it. It was a slow start, and I'm not sure if I love the way the story is told, but I started it, and I'm going to finish it to see if I enjoyed it. My BFF has it on her TBR and we usually enjoy the same books, so maybe we can chat about it once I'm done.

        I'm a newer romantasy reader about 4 books into Hades x Persephone series... I personally haven't loved it. It has been hard for me to take it seriously, so I'm not feeling very invested. I'm curious now about the ending and may just have to listen to it to see where it goes, for the entertainment.

            The story under the romance I thought was an interesting concept, and I love the idea of reading from Persephone's perspective and Hades perspective, but ARGGGHHH

    Currently **Desolation** by **Yasmina Reza**.
    
    I stumbled over her works by watching the excellent **God of Carnage** - which is not a gore movie as the title implies, but rather a very dark comedy.
    
    **Desolation** is a long rant from an old man that is extremely unhappy how his son turned out - because he choses "being happy" instead of "being productive". So far it is unclear if the son is even present while the guy is just laying into him. It is also about missed chances, the ethics of work and the general question what makes a life a life well lived.
    
    Some selected quotes, crudely translated from my german translation:
    
    > In my philosophy, the father expects the son to NOT turn out like the rest of the world.
    
    > May I introduce you to my son, from the gang of the beheaded flowers. I would have preferred if you had become a criminal or terrorist rather than an activist of happiness.
