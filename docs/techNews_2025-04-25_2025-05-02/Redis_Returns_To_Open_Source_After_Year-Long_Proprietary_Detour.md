# Redis Returns To Open Source After Year-Long Proprietary Detour

Redis, the popular in-memory data store, has [returned to open source licensing with Redis 8](https://thenewstack.io/redis-is-open-source-again/) now available under the AGPL v3 license. The move reverses last year's controversial [shift to proprietary licensing schemes (RSALv2 and SSPLv1)](https://bsd.slashdot.org/story/24/03/21/225211/redis-to-adopt-source-available-licensing-starting-with-next-version) that aimed to force major cloud providers to pay for offering Redis as a managed service.

The decision follows significant market pressure, including AWS, Google, and Oracle [backing the Valkey fork](https://news.slashdot.org/story/24/09/01/072220/open-source-redis-fork-valkey-has-momentum-improvements-and-speed-says-dirk-hohndel), which gained momentum in the open source community.

Redis believes the AGPL license provides sufficient protection from cloud providers while satisfying open source requirements. Redis 8 will incorporate vector sets and integrate previously separate Redis Stack features including JSON, Time Series, and probabilistic data support.
