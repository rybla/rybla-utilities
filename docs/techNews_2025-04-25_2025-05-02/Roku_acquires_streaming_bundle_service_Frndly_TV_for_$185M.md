# Roku acquires streaming bundle service Frndly TV for $185M

[Roku](https://deadline.com/tag/roku/) is paying $185 million to acquire [Frndly TV](https://deadline.com/tag/frndly-tv/), a provider of low-cost TV bundles delivered via [streaming](https://deadline.com/tag/streaming/).

The all-cash deal includes $75 million in holdbacks tied to certain performance targets and milestones over the next two years.

Roku announced the deal at the same time it [reported](https://deadline.com/2025/05/roku-q1-2025-earnings-streaming-economy-1236382885/) first-quarter earnings, with revenue rising 16% to $1.02 billion.

The deal, which is expected to close during the current April-to-June quarter, brings another scaled tech player into the world of internet-delivered [pay-TV](https://deadline.com/tag/pay-tv/). The sector is currently dominated by YouTube TV, which has 8 million subscribers. Disney is also making moves in the space, having agreed to acquire Fubo earlier this year, giving it 6 million subscribers between Fubo and Hulu + Live TV.

Denver-based Frndly operates at the lower end of the price spectrum, with plans offering dozens of general-entertainment channels for $7 to $13 a month. After launching in 2019, the company said it had reached 700,000 subscribers by 2022, with a lineup including A&E, Hallmark Channel, The History Channel and Lifetime, plus thousands of hours of on-demand content. In avoiding pricey sports programming, the service positioned itself similarly to Philo TV, which has cracked the 1 million subscriber mark after a longer run in the marketplace.

“Frndly TV’s impressive growth and expertise in direct-to-consumer subscription services make it a compelling addition to Roku,” Roku founder and CEO Anthony Wood said. “This acquisition supports our focus on growing platform revenue and Roku-billed subscriptions, with a live content offering our users love at an industry-leading price point.”

Frndly TV’s team, including co-founder and CEO Andy Karofsky, will stay on after the transaction closes.

“We’re incredibly excited to join Roku and continue our mission to provide customers feel-good, quality entertainment as the most affordable live TV subscription streaming service in America,” Karofsky said. “Roku’s pioneering role in streaming and its longstanding commitment to customers aligns perfectly with our strategic vision. We believe this combination will help us accelerate subscription growth, given the alignment in core customer demographics and Roku’s leadership position in the connected TV ecosystem.”
