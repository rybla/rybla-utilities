[My GMU Econ colleague Dan Klein writes wisely, at _National Review_, about the so-called “trade deficit.”](https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/cafehayek-whereordersemerge-articlefeed/~https://www.nationalreview.com/2025/04/the-surplus-americans-dont-hear-about/) A slice:

> The point is not to repeat the important truth that the trade deficit corresponds to the capital-account surplus. Rather, the point is that the whole conventional framework assumes that the goal of international trade is to husband money rather than real goods and services.
>
> Maybe that framework stems from the government’s basic instinct and natural interest in finding the dollars and taking a portion of them. After all, taxes are paid in dollars, not in stuff!
>
> It comes down to a choice between two perspectives, each corresponding to what will be given a positive sign and what will be given a negative sign — the money or the stuff? The Nobel economist Thomas Schelling noted that there is “no significance, other than custom, in the choice of sign.” Had the convention developed differently, what is now called a “trade deficit” could have been called a “trade surplus.”
>
> The next time you hear President Trump inveigh about our “trade deficit” with China, say to yourself: We have a _stuff surplus_ with China — wording that sounds much less ominous than a “trade deficit with China” and that is therefore less likely to fuel support for unwise protectionist measures.

[Norbert Michel describes the attempt to bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. as “a fool’s errand.”](https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/cafehayek-whereordersemerge-articlefeed/~https://www.cato.org/blog/trying-bring-back-manufacturing-jobs-fools-errand) A slice:

> In other words, even though the Trump administration seems bent on “bringing back” manufacturing jobs to the United States, most Americans recognize that service sector jobs have already made America great.
>
> You’d never guess it from all the political rhetoric, but service sector jobs have _always_ been a major factor in America’s success.
>
> As I explain in my [new book](https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/cafehayek-whereordersemerge-articlefeed/~https://www.cato.org/books/crushing-capitalism), _Crushing Capitalism_, service jobs have accounted for a larger share of the US labor force than heavy industry since 1840, and a larger share than agriculture since the early 1900s. Similarly, the service sector’s share of total output exceeded heavy industry’s share during most of US history, with the only exception being a brief period around 1890.

[Financial markets continue – as explained by the _Wall Street Journal_‘s Editorial Board – to announce clearly and forcefully that protectionism is economically destructive (and, hence, freer trade is economically productive)](https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/cafehayek-whereordersemerge-articlefeed/~https://www.wsj.com/opinion/markets-scott-bessent-tariffs-china-donald-trump-trade-war-73b92b5b?mod=opinion_lead_pos2). A slice:

> Do you think the markets are trying to tell President Trump something? Stocks and the dollar rose Tuesday after word leaked that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told a private investor conference that he expected trade tensions between the U.S. and China to ease soon.
>
> The main equity indexes regained most of their losses from Monday after various media sources confirmed the Treasury secretary’s optimism that both China and the U.S. don’t want the current all-out trade war to continue. He also reportedly said Mr. Trump’s goal in imposing 145% tariffs on imports from China wasn’t to totally decouple the two economies.
>
> If Mr. Bessent knows what Mr. Trump’s real China and trade strategies are, everyone would love to hear it because so far it looks like ad hoc improvisation. But we—and the markets—will take whatever good news we can get these days. So would businesses across the country that are freezing investment or not hiring as they try to figure out what will happen when Mr. Trump’s 90-day pause on his highest non-China tariffs ends.
>
> Among those who’d like to know are the 800 or so Volvo employees at three different U.S. plants that will be laid off in the next 90 days. They include 250-350 workers at a Mack Truck plant in Macungie, Pa.; 250-350 at a Volvo truck plant in Dublin, Va.; and 50-100 at a Volvo plant in Hagerstown, Md., that makes engines and transmissions for both brands.
>
> The company explained that it had to align its production with falling truck orders that “continue to be negatively affected by market uncertainty about freight rates and demand, possible regulatory changes, and the impact of tariffs.” We hear similar comments about uncertainty everywhere.

[With this letter in today’s _Wall Street Journal_, GMU Econ alum Dave Hebert supplements Phil Gramm’s and my latest essay on trade](https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/cafehayek-whereordersemerge-articlefeed/~https://www.wsj.com/opinion/when-tariffs-raked-in-revenue-for-washington-social-security-defense-healthcare-85ef8d02?mod=opinion_feat4_letterstoeditors_pos2):

> Phil Gramm and Donald Boudreaux write persuasively about the harms of tariffs (“[Trump’s Tariffs Are as Bad as Bidenomics](https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/cafehayek-whereordersemerge-articlefeed/~https://www.wsj.com/opinion/trumps-tariffs-are-as-bad-as-bidenomics-d8a0d92b?mod=article_inline),” op-ed, April 15). Yet they missed an opportunity to correct another mistake. Tariff proponents often contend that tariffs were the major source of revenue for the federal government during the 19th century. What they neglect to mention is that the federal government did next to nothing compared with what it does today.
>
> Consider the top five budget items Congress spends money on each year. Social Security wasn’t signed into law until 1935, interest payments on the national debt as well as defense spending were trivial compared with present levels, and Medicare and Medicaid wouldn’t appear until 1965. These five items alone account for nearly $5 trillion of the total $7 trillion that Congress is projected to spend this year.
>
> It’s easy to pay for the government when the government does few things.

> **David Hebert**
> _American Inst. for Economic Research_

[Here’s the news release on the Anti-Tariff Declaration pioneered by Phil Magness (and in which I and some other played a role in drafting)](https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/cafehayek-whereordersemerge-articlefeed/~https://www.independent.org/news-release/2025/04/22/hundreds-of-economists-demand-end-to-harmful-tariff-policies/).

[Mohamed Moutii is correct: “Congress must take back control over tariffs.”](https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/cafehayek-whereordersemerge-articlefeed/~https://thedailyeconomy.org/article/congress-must-take-back-control-over-tariffs/) A slice:

> Congress has tried to push back, but with little success. Speaker Mike Johnson has [blocked](https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/cafehayek-whereordersemerge-articlefeed/~https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-faces-growing-republican-pushback-over-tariffs-2055261) House votes to end the emergency declarations that underpin Trump’s tariffs on Canada. Bills to restore congressional oversight have stalled. Any serious effort would likely face a Trump veto, leaving lawmakers paralyzed and the executive unchecked.
>
> This stalemate points to a broader constitutional crisis: the steady erosion of congressional authority in favor of unchecked presidential power. What began as a practical delegation to simplify trade negotiations has become a blank check for protectionism. And the fallout isn’t just legal — it’s economic.
>
> Tariffs imposed without oversight drive up prices on everything from electronics to clothing, burdening American consumers and businesses. They rattle investors, disrupt global supply chains, and strain ties with key allies already on edge.

[Matthew Blakey explains that “if the U.S. is to lead the future, it won’t be by protecting the past.”](https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/cafehayek-whereordersemerge-articlefeed/~https://www.realclearmarkets.com/articles/2025/04/21/if_the_us_is_to_lead_the_future_it_wont_be_by_protecting_the_past_1105138.html) Two slices:

> Yet today there is a mounting temptation—especially from politicians and policymakers— to turn back the clock. From calls to “bring back” American manufacturing to government subsidies for outdated industries, the pull of nostalgia to relive the past is highly detrimental to US innovation. Schumpeter warned against this very instinct. The promise of capitalism was never about preservation, but progress. Rather than pouring valuable resources into resurrecting obsolete sectors, we should focus on removing the barriers to allow space for the next wave of advancements.
>
> …..
>
> It’s often forgotten that creative destruction is not merely an economic process—it’s a strategic advantage. Countries that suppress disruption in favor of preservation or stability often consign themselves to years of stagnation. Much of Europe, for example, has spent decades prioritizing industrial stability, rigid labor protections, and regulatory caution over economic dynamism. In a September 2024 article for the International Monetary Fund, Cerdeiro, Hong, and Kammer observe that the productivity and market valuations of U.S.-listed companies far outpace their European counterparts—attributing the gap to America’s embrace of innovation.

[Daniel Hannan makes the case for free trade in six simple points](https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/cafehayek-whereordersemerge-articlefeed/~https://conservativehome.com/2025/04/23/daniel-hannan-the-conservative-case-for-globalisation-in-six-simple-points/). A slice:

> A trade deficit must be matched by a capital surplus, and vice versa. A foreigner who holds sterling can ultimately do one of only two things with it: buy British exports, or buy assets in Britain. Politicians like to celebrate both inward investment and export successes, and both are indeed good things to the extent that they show a global economy operating properly.
>
> But, by mathematical logic, the more you have of one, the less you will have of the other. Donald Trump’s failure to grasp this point is about to plunge the US into recession.

[Jeff Luse reports that Trump’s tariffs surely please many radical environmentalists](https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/cafehayek-whereordersemerge-articlefeed/~https://reason.com/2025/04/22/trumps-tariffs-are-threatening-a-3-billion-nuclear-power-plant-restart-in-michigan/). A slice:

> President Donald Trump’s trade policies have disrupted every sector of the economy, including [energy](https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/cafehayek-whereordersemerge-articlefeed/~https://reason.com/2025/03/28/trump-is-sabotaging-his-drill-baby-drill-agenda/). A nuclear power plant project in Michigan could be the latest victim of the president’s tariffs.

# Fairer Trade Is Grossly Unfair

Here’s a letter to a new correspondent.

> Mr. H\_\_:
>
> You express support for Trump’s tariffs because, as you write, “they will allow the president to strike deals making trade fairer.”
>
> With respect, you’re mistaken, if for no reason other than this: What protectionist politicians and pundits mean when they talk of “fairness” in trade is, in fact, unfairness to most of their fellow citizens.
>
> Suppose a merchant offers to sell you a bushel of apples for $55. Happy with this offer, you accept. After handing three $20 bills to the merchant, he then gives to you only three-quarters of a bushel _and_ refuses to give you $5 in change. You would rightly describe this merchant’s action as unfair; you were tricked into paying more for less. To put it scientifically, you were screwed.
>
> Protectionist politicians negotiating for “fair trade” aim to screw their fellow citizens in the same manner. Operating under the delusion that exporting is the end-goal of trade and that importing is merely a means to increase exports, when protectionist American politicians negotiate for “fair trade,” the deal they seek is for Americans to export (that is, to pay) more to foreigners and to receive from foreigners (that is, to import) less in exchange. This process and its results are outrageously _un_fair.
>
> Politicians get away with perpetuating this unfairness because too many people naively take politicians at their word. But don’t be a fool. When a politician obstructs your freedom to spend your money as you wish, and justifies this meddling by telling you that he or she is negotiating for “fair trade,” recognize that that official is arranging for you and your fellow Americans to give to foreigners more in exchange, and for foreigners to give to you and your fellow Americans less in exchange. The benefits of this boondoggle are reaped by a handful of politically powerful American producers, while the larger costs are imposed on the bulk of Americans – including you. And nothing about this arrangement is remotely fair.

[Too cowardly to man-up and take responsibility for the destruction that he is wreaking on America’s (and, hence, the world’s) economy – and implicitly conceding that he doesn’t believe his earlier statement that the rout on Wall Street is a temporary, “yippie” overreaction to the glorious restructuring that he fancies himself to be engineering – Trump blames Jerome Powell and the Fed](https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/cafehayek-whereordersemerge-articlefeed/~https://www.wsj.com/economy/central-banking/donald-trump-fed-jerome-powell-blame-b6d4189f?mod=finance_lead_pos3).

[Jeff Jacoby, conservative columnist for the _Boston Globe_, explains cogently and concisely that Trump’s tariffs are not statutorily justified and, hence, are an unconstitutional exercise of power](https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/cafehayek-whereordersemerge-articlefeed/~https://jeffjacoby.com/28486/no-tariffs-without-representation). A slice:

> But what about his predecessors? How often did _they_ use the IEEPA to raise and lower tariffs?
>
> Not once.
>
> In the nearly half-century since President Jimmy Carter signed that statute, no president _ever_ invoked it to impose tariffs — not against any country and not for any reason. That wasn’t because seven consecutive presidents failed to make use of a powerful tool granted to them by Congress. It was because no such tool exists.
>
> Trump’s assertions notwithstanding, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act does not authorize presidents to singlehandedly change the tariffs charged on foreign imports. Indeed, nowhere in [the 3,700-word statute](https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/cafehayek-whereordersemerge-articlefeed/~https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/COMPS-1079/uslm/COMPS-1079.xml) does the word “tariff” appear. Neither does “duty,” “excise,” “impost,” “levy,” or any other synonym for the taxes charged by governments on imports from other countries. The IEEPA has nothing to do with tariffs. It doesn’t even appear in the section of the United States Code — [Title 19](https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/cafehayek-whereordersemerge-articlefeed/~https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_19_of_the_United_States_Code) — that deals with trade. Rather, it is codified in [Title 50](https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/cafehayek-whereordersemerge-articlefeed/~https://uscode.house.gov/download/annualhistoricalarchives/pdf/2008/2008usc50.pdf), which covers “War and National Defense.”
>
> Congress passed the law in 1977 to enable presidents to deal quickly with a national emergency during peacetime by ordering sanctions against, or freezing the assets of, a hostile foreign power or terrorist organization. The legislative text refers to an “emergency” that gives rise to “an unusual and extraordinary threat” — in fact, lawmakers [specified](https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/cafehayek-whereordersemerge-articlefeed/~https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/the-case-against-ieepa-tariffs) that “emergencies are by their nature rare and brief, and are not to be equated with normal, ongoing problems.” That clearly excludes the supposed emergency identified by the Trump administration to justify its punitive “Liberation Day” tariffs, namely the trade deficits the United States runs with many trading partners. Those deficits have persisted for decades. They are not “unusual and extraordinary.” They are also, nearly all [mainstream economists](https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/cafehayek-whereordersemerge-articlefeed/~https://www.cato.org/blog/ignore-politicians-trade-deficits-dont-really-matter) would agree, [not a threat](https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/cafehayek-whereordersemerge-articlefeed/~https://time.com/7275957/trump-tariffs-usa-trade-deficits-economic-growth-strength-world-order/).

America’s unemployment rate is unlikely to be lower than it currently is, at least on a sustained basis – over the last few years, basically everyone in the US who wanted a job could get one. True, a large number of people are out of the job market entirely. But market wages would presumably need to be higher for many of them to enter the workforce.

In America, the average manufacturing worker [already earns less](https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/cafehayek-whereordersemerge-articlefeed/~https://www.cato.org/blog/united-states-remains-manufacturing-powerhouse) than the average service-sector worker. And if Trump is serious about bringing back factory jobs from overseas, then the average manufacturing wage in the US would drop. \[Commerce secretary Howard\] Lutnick may want Americans “screwing in little screws,” but businesses aren’t going to pay high wages for that type of work. There are many reasons why we should not wish for legions of Americans to stitch sneakers together in factories, but chief among them is that those are low-wage jobs.

… is from chapter 3 of William Graham Sumner’s great 1885 book, [_Protectionism: the -ism Which Teaches that Waste Makes Wealth_](https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/cafehayek-whereordersemerge-articlefeed/~oll.libertyfund.org/titles/sumner-protectionism-the-ism-which-teaches-that-waste-makes-wealth) (footnotes deleted):

> _![](https://cafehayek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Unknown-20.jpeg)The protectionists make much of their pretended “nationalism,” and they try to reason out some kind of relationship between the scope of economic forces and the boundaries of existing nations. The argumentation is fatally broken at its first step. They do not show what they might show, viz., that the scope of economic forces on any given stage of the arts, does form economic units. An English county was such a unit a century ago. I doubt if any thing less than the whole earth could be considered so to-day, when the wool of Australia, the hides of South America, the cotton of Alabama, the wheat of Manitoba and the meat of Texas meet the laborers in Manchester and Sheffield, and would meet the laborers in Lowell and Paterson, if the barriers were out of the way. But what the national protectionist would need to show would be that the economic unit coincides with the political unit. He would have to affirm that Maine and Texas are in one economic unit, but that Maine and New Brunswick are not; or that Massachusetts and Minnesota are in one economic unit, but that Massachusetts and Manitoba are not. Every existing state is a product of historic accidents. Mr. Jefferson set out to buy the city of New Orleans. He awoke one morning to find that he had bought the western half of the Mississippi valley. Since that turned out so the protectionists think that Missouri and Illinois prosper by trading in perfect freedom._
>
> _If it had not turned out so, it would have been very mischievous for them to trade in perfect freedom. Nova Scotia did not join the revolt of our thirteen colonies. Hence it is thought ruinous to let coal and potatoes come in freely from Nova Scotia. If she had revolted with us, it would have been for the benefit of every body in this union to trade with her as freely as we now trade with Maine. We tried to conquer Canada in 1812–13 and failed Consequently the Canadians now put taxes on our coal and petroleum and wheat, and we put taxes on their lumber, which our coal and petroleum industries need. We did annex Texas, at the cost of war, in 1845. Consequently we trade with Texas now under absolute freedom, but, if we trade with Mexico, it must be only very carefully and under stringent limitations. Is this wisdom, or is it all pure folly and wrong headedness, by which men who boast of their intelligence throw away their own chances?_

# Ted Koppel Does a Lousy Job on USAID

*Source: <https://www.econlib.org/ted-koppel-does-a-lousy-job-on-usaid/>*
*Published: 2025-04-23T22:40:48.000Z*

I watch CBS Sunday morning every week. One segment on April 20 was [Ted Koppel’s look at the cuts in USAID spending](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/usaid-and-the-dangers-posed-by-cuts-to-u-s-foreign-aid/). There were three main things wrong with his reporting, all of which showed laziness or indifference or something else.

Koppel interviewed a British politician named David Miliband. Koppel stated:

> For the past 12 years he’s \[Miliband\] been president and CEO of the International Rescue Committee. The IRC delivers humanitarian aid to some of the most vulnerable people in the world. So far, says Miliband, the cuts have affected about 40% of their international programs.

Then he showed heart-wrenching scenes about poor people in poor countries who will no longer get treatments for disease.

I wondered three things and Koppel didn’t try to answer them.

First, what percentage of the many billions of USAID spending went to this program? I’m guessing it’s a small percentage, but I’d like to know. Maybe we could cut the really bad stuff out of USAID and leave some of these programs that seem worthwhile.

The above is what I wonder as a numerate American independent of my political views.

Earlier in the segment was this:

> And White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt provides the harmony, telling reporters on February 3, “I don’t know about you, but as an American taxpayer, I don’t want my dollars going towards this crap.”

Leavitt and Trump have a legitimate concern. That brings me to the second question I would have liked Koppel to ask.

The second question: How much corruption and waste is there in USAID?

My third question is one I would want answered because I think it’s wrong to forcibly take people’s money to help people in other countries, even if the money goes to good things, as some of it seems to do.

The question is this: Are there private organizations that take voluntary donations and use it for such programs? I would be shocked if there weren’t. I turned to my wife and said, “If there were such programs, and if they did a good job, I would donate a few hundred dollars.” That way, we could get the benefits of USAID without the corruption, without the waste, and without forcibly taking money from people.

If Koppel’s main concern had been those poor kids in Africa, he would have looked into this. Instead, it came off as another attempt to bash Donald Trump and Elon Musk.

Of course, I’m assuming that Koppel had agency. Maybe he didn’t. If so, then my criticism is of the producer(s) of the segment.

_PS:_ One plausible candidate to give money to is the earlier mentioned [International Rescue Committee](https://www.rescue.org). It looks promising. I’ll look into it. Why wouldn’t Koppel mention to that viewers as an option? It would have taken about 5 seconds.

_PPS_: I checked [IRC’s Form 990 for 2021.](https://www.rescue.org/sites/default/files/2022-08/FY2021%20IRC%20990.pdf) It gives the compensation of some of the main people. David Miliband made a little over $1 million from IRC that year. He could be worth it. But it makes me nervous.

# The Vice President Meets the Pope

*Source: <https://www.econlib.org/jd-vance-meets-the-pope/>*
*Published: 2025-04-23T16:15:46.000Z*

Vice President JD Vance, a Catholic, met Pope Francis on April 20, the day before the latter’s death. The meeting with the enfeebled pope was brief and did not touch upon their disagreement about the treatment of immigrants. Early this year, Francis had declared that the mass deportation plan “damages the dignity of many men and women” (“[JD Vance Was Among Last to Meet Pope Francis](https://www.wsj.com/world/europe/vance-meets-francis-ahead-of-papal-easter-message-urging-compassion-for-migrants-c3056b11),” _Wall Street Journal_, April 21, 2025). I think it is difficult not to share the late pope’s concern on this point, but the larger picture is more interesting.

While the pope is known as a man of the left advocating “social justice,” JD Vance supports “the right” wherever he sees it. It is not immediately obvious how these two individuals can [belong to the same Church](https://www.econlib.org/the-strangers-who-live-among-you/). Is that an irreconcilable disagreement? Casuistry could no doubt pull a few rabbits from the pope’s tiara or the vice-president’s MAGA cap. Moreover, and interestingly, the two protagonists could reconcile their differences by invoking what they both disagree with in classical liberal political economy—if only they knew anything about that.

As classical liberal (and libertarian) theorists have explained, the concept of social justice makes unambiguous sense only in an authoritarian social system where the political rulers assign rewards and punishments to individuals in society. In a spontaneous order, no authority can do that: rewards and punishments are determined according to largely impersonal factors such as who better satisfies the demand of unknown persons on extended markets; other impersonal factors, such as luck, accidents, and the laws of physics, also play a role.

To see this, we may consult what I believe are the three major classical liberal or libertarian strands of thought in our time. (1) Friedrich Hayek has offered an argument against social justice similar to what I just described: see his _[The Mirage of Social Justice](https://www.wsj.com/world/europe/vance-meets-francis-ahead-of-papal-easter-message-urging-compassion-for-migrants-c3056b11)_, originally the third volume of his _Law, Legislation, and Liberty_. (2) The [anarcho-liberal or anarcho-conservative](https://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/serials/files/regulation/2019/3/regulation-v42n1-7-updated.pdf) economist and political philosopher Anthony de Jasay arrives at a similar conclusion, also based on spontaneous rules of conduct (which, in the manner of David Hume, he calls “conventions”) but without the state: see, among his works, _[Justice and Its Surroundings](https://www.cato.org/regulation/spring-2025/book-review-justice-its-surroundings#readings)_. (3) James Buchanan and the school of Constitutional Political Economy rehabilitate the state through unanimous consent (that is, individual veto). In this contractarian theory, justice lies in rules that are unanimously accepted and certainly not in a conception of justice imposed by political authority: a summary can be found in Geoffrey Brennan and James Buchanan, _[The Reason of Rules](https://www.econlib.org/library/columns/y2023/lemieuxconstitutionalrules.html#_ftnref6)_. (Note that, for Buchanan as for Hayek, being opposed to arbitrary “social justice” does not imply that the state cannot offer some sort of income insurance.)

If that is correct, we can say that both the (late) pope and JD Vance believe in social justice, that is, in political authority assigning rewards and punishments throughout society, although Vance uses other words than “social justice.” The pope believes that political authorities should favor the poor at the expense of the rich all over the world. JD Vance believes that the favored groups should be whoever the holders of political power in America think are deserving—and who are likely the obedient supporters of such rulers. Many of his tirades would have been approved by Francis if he did not add “American” to his favored groups (“[JD Vance Proclaims ‘America First’ as Republicans Embrace Economic Populism](https://www.ft.com/content/1882d80c-4835-4397-b91f-5218156c3269?utm_source=chatgpt.com),” _Financial Times_, July 18, 2014):

> “We are done, ladies and gentlemen, catering to Wall Street. We’ll commit to the working man,” he said. “We’re done importing foreign labour, we are going to fight for American citizens and their good jobs and their good wages.” He added: “We need a leader who is not in the pocket of big business, but answers to the working man, union and non-union alike, a leader who won’t sell out to multinational corporations, but will stand up for American corporations and American industry.”

In Argentina, the pope was known by many as “the Peronist pope,” after Juan Domingo Perón, a populist of the left whose presidency contributed to the Argentine decline. The _Financial Times_ notes (Michael Stott, “[Was Francis the First Peronist Pope?](https://www.ft.com/content/79a411f4-11ec-4bfd-938a-d7567dced14d)” April 23, 2025):

> “Perón used to say that the doctrine of Peronism was the social doctrine of the church,” said Ignácio Zuleta, author of a study of Francis entitled The Peronist Pope. Both church and Peronists emphasised social justice and the fight against poverty, while advocating conservative social mores.

Whether Francis-style or _à la_ Vance, “social justice” is an instance of a larger ideology. The two men are both collectivists, that is, they both favor collective and political choices over individual and private choices. They simply favor different collective choices made by different people in metering rewards and punishments over the whole society. It is quite sure that Vance does not disagree with Francis when the latter expressed his opposition to what he ignorantly described as “the neoliberal dogma \[which\] pursues easy profits as its main goal \[and\] continues to cause serious damage” (“[Les 10 phrases marquantes du pape François : ‘Saint Pierre n’avait pas de compte en banque,’](https://www.lemonde.fr/le-monde-des-religions/article/2025/04/21/mort-du-pape-francois-son-pontificat-en-10-phrases-marquantes_6598603_6038514.html)” _Le Monde_, April 20, 2025).

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

The featured image of this post imagines Pope Francis and JD Vance arriving together at the Pearly Gates (the lag being due to a dent in the space-time continuum). Before St. Peter, who assigns the contemplation seats in heaven, the pope is smiling and naïve, while Vance is naïve and angry. After all, they both believe in “social justice,” but their criteria for assigning rewards and punishments differ.

Of course, as there is (by definition) no scarcity in heaven, the reader of this blog should understand that place assignments must be a mere ritual with no practical consequence.

# Silver Linings and Green Clouds

*Source: <https://www.econlib.org/silver-linings-and-green-clouds/>*
*Published: 2025-04-23T13:45:02.000Z*

As I write this, it’s been about two weeks since the “Liberation Day” tariffs were announced.  While nobody expects political economic models to be stellar (see the myriad of “economic impact studies” that come out for any project that just _happen_ to coincide with what the local politician wants to hear), the model released by the USTR/CEA stands out.  I, and many others, [have already written about its numerous faults](https://www.econlib.org/on-the-reciprocal-tariff-plan/).  It reads like an undergrad essay thrown together at the last minute following a furious run through Google Scholar rather than a considered scientific recommendation.  Further defense by Council of Economic Advisers chair Stephen Miran has been inadequate as well as he continuously misapplies citations and uses discredited models to advance the plan.  These are _post hoc_ justifications for a desired policy rather than a policy crafted to solve a real problem.  

But I remain ever the optimist, and I do see some silver linings from this hot mess.  As [Frederic Bastiat once said](https://oll-resources.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/oll3/store/titles/276/Bastiat_0182_EBk_v6.0.pdf), “\[T\]he worst thing that can happen to a good cause is, not to be skillfully attacked, but to be ineptly defended.”  The natural corollary to that is the _best_ thing that can happen to a bad cause is to be ineptly defended.  So, a silver lining from this ill-conceived and ineptly defended tariff scheme could be a sustained demise of protectionist and mercantilist nonsense.  Protectionism [hasn’t been very popular,](https://www.econlib.org/why-i-write/) and a February [poll by Gallup](https://news.gallup.com/poll/657581/americans-foreign-policy-priorities-nato-support-unchanged.aspx) shows that an overwhelming majority of Americans (81%) see trade as an opportunity for economic growth (a mere 14% see it as a threat) **(Update:** [A poll conducted April 8-9](https://www.wsj.com/opinion/a-new-poll-shows-the-peril-of-trumps-tariffs-trade-policy-economy-approval-ratings-505e61f5) find 84% of respondents want free trade, and only about 45% favor the Trump tariff plan).  Even among Republicans, this stance holds, with 78% believing trade represents opportunities.  Given the heavy stock market losses and generalized chaos from the first few weeks of April, I’d suspect that those attitudes haven’t changed much (or, more likely, people have become even more skeptical of the Administration’s policies).  The silver lining I see could be that [protectionism](https://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/Protectionism.html) continues its popular decline given how ineptly its greatest champion has defended it.  Maybe if Trump continues to spend his resources defending this hill, his attention will be drawn away from some even worse policies.  

That said, there are substantial green tornadic clouds attached to this silver lining.  By writing and defending this report, the Council of Economic Advisors has greatly tarnished its reputation.  One of the results we see in the literature on expert opinion over and over again is that when experts are over precise, provide low-quality information, and do not discuss alternatives, trust in them falls.  This result holds even if the information ends up being correct.  Accuracy does matter, but more importantly for communication is that the expert be forthright.  The economists defending the tariff scheme, most notably Steven Miran, have been anything but forthright.  Miran has even been called out for misrepresenting or outright lying about the information he cites.  All this undermines what has, until these past few months, been a reliable source of expert advice.  Diminishing the reputation of the CEA could cause the rise of economic “flat-earthism.”

We saw a similar event with public health during COVID.  Fauci et al were not forthright about COVID, vaccines, or anything really.  Fauci even said on multiple occasions that he lied or misled in order to accomplish some goal.  Consequently, public confidence in the public health administrations plummeted and we saw the rise of anti-vaxxer sentiments.\*  Fauci et al ineptly defended public health and it had led to disastrous outcomes.  I fear the same with my own profession.

A careful reader will note the two effects I discuss are counter to the other.  I do not know which will ultimately prevail.  To keep my metaphor going, sometimes the green clouds just hide a lot of rain and the silver lining prevails.  Other times, the silver lining is diminished by a strong and destructive tornado.  I hope for the silver lining.  But I fear the tornado.

\*Note: when I say “anti-vaxxer” I mean literally, in that they are anti-vaccine.  Someone who opposes mandates is not an anti-vaxxer.

# Introducing Fewer Rules, Better People: The Case for Discretion

*Source: <https://www.econlib.org/introducing-fewer-rules-better-people-the-case-for-discretion/>*
*Published: 2025-04-22T16:34:30.000Z*

Ideas can often be introduced to us in unusual places. The British comedian David Mitchell once [quipped](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjG9JcyLYbw) that his introductions to Proust and Wagner came from Monty Python and Bugs Bunny respectively. In my own life, I was first motivated to think about the argument over the relative value of rules and discretion while watching the then newly-released TV series _24_ with my father. As he put it at the time, there are two forces at play in the world that often work at cross-purposes with each other – attention to procedure, and getting the job done. The protagonist of _24_, Jack Bauer, was very much into the “just get the job done” side of things and frequently disregarded rules and procedures to do so, much to the consternation of many of his colleagues and superiors.

![](https://www.econlib.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/51lEaYqv16L._SY445_SX342_.jpg)

Of course, this tension has implications beyond its ability to make for good television, notwithstanding how entertaining it is to see Jack Bauer bark out “There’s no time for that!” at one of his rules-oriented colleagues before charging into action. The interaction between acting according to rules and acting according to discretion is of enormous importance in many areas of life, and finding the right balance between the two is one of those areas where there is an very broad range for reasonable disagreement. A recent book, [_Fewer Rules, Better People: The Case for Discretion_](https://amzn.to/4jDedyZ) by the philosopher Barry Lam makes the case that modern society has moved too far into rules, and needs to allow more space for discretion.

(And, as is always the case when I do these long-form reviews, my posts will simply be my attempts to present Lam’s arguments as accurately as I can. My own views and evaluation of Lam’s arguments will be saved for the final posts in the series. If readers have questions or comments, my responses will be meant to reflect the view contained in Lam’s book rather than my own.)

Lam opens by giving a broad statement of how deeply entrenched rules and procedures have becoming into living modern life:

> Besides death and taxes, the third great certainty about civilized life is bureaucracy. You cannot live or die without submitting proper paperwork to the proper authorities. Be born without a birth certificate and you will not exist. Die without a death certificate and you will continue to owe money to a government unable to recognize that you no longer exist. Try to earn, win, or even give away any significant amount of money and you will need to fill out some series of forms, pay some kind of administrative fee, and stand in some line.

Furthermore, Lam argues, this drive towards rules and procedures for everything is self-perpetuating. In any organization, as new situations emerge, new rules are created to account for them. This is especially true when something disastrous happens. In the wake of a striking event, the natural tendency is for people to say “If procedure X had been in place, this could have been prevented. Therefore, from now on, everyone must follow procedure X in all cases.” This process piles up and builds on itself:

> One scandal is enough to cause major procedural reactions. It is built into the evolutionary structure of organizations of scale to encounter problems and liabilities and to fix them by formulating a new rule sent out by memo for other people to implement. It is part of that same evolution for someone somewhere to find a loophole in the rule, leading to an additional clause, culminating in dozens of pages of fine print, and then a computer system that collects, organizes, and sends information in accordance with those rules.

Eventually this accumulation of rules and regulations grows to the point that people can barely operate within the system anymore:

> Bureaucracy in theory is supposed to be an essential solution to the problems of social organization, but in practice it often leads to a frustrated citizen staring incredulously at a helpless worker in a system with no good choices among a mountain of rules.

Lam’s case is not that rules are intrinsically bad, or that rules can be dispensed with altogether. He argues that any system will always require a combination of rules and discretion. But he defines the debate in terms of which of the two is seen as more desirable, and which of the two is considered at best a tolerable departure from the desirable. Those who argue for the primacy of rules over discretion are, in Lam’s terminology, referred to as _legalists_:

> The legalist believes that justice requires detailed and sprawling rulemaking, with discretion a necessary evil (because rules are imperfect). I believe that justice requires discretion, with complex rulemaking a necessary evil (since rulers are imperfect).

In addition to arguing against legalists, Lam realizes his case will be met with suspicion by people among a wide range of political philosophies, such as libertarians:

> Even libertarians, who are no fans of burdensome and complex rules, believe that discretion is bad. Top-down authority in general is suspicious, so more top-down authority \[in the form of discretion\] given to bureaucrats is an evil.

Left-anarchists, too, would object:

> Similarly, in the anarchist left, where direct democracy is an ideal, no one should have special authority to sidestep or bend rules. That would be to give a member of the community unequal power, a most repugnant state of affairs in an anarchist society.

In contrast, Lam argues that “discretion is a constitutive feature of a well-run institution that seeks to maximize fairness, justice, efficiency, and effectiveness.”

But in order to effectively argue against legalism, Lam needs to first define what it means to be a legalist and consider the arguments in favor of a legalist approach – arguments that Lam admits are strong and weighty. In the next post, I’ll be outlining Lam’s explication of the arguments for legalism.

# Health Care Markets Fail So Government Must Intervene? Kenneth Arrow Said No Such Thing

*Source: <https://www.econlib.org/health-care-markets-fail-so-government-must-intervene-kenneth-arrow-said-no-such-thing/>*
*Published: 2025-04-22T12:30:00.000Z*

We’ve all heard the [ritual](https://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2017/3/6/14826974/health-care-aca-philosophy-republican-obamacare) [incantation](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/6/30/15879702/health-care-capitalism-free-market-socialism-single-payer): _Kenneth Arrow showed that markets fail in health care, so government must intervene_.

What comes next is dealer’s choice. You may be in for a pitch on [regulating nurse practitioners](https://www.cato.org/policy-analysis/health-care-workforce-reform-covid-19-spotlights-need-changes-clinician-licensing). Or against physicians dispensing medicines. Or for price controls on pharmaceuticals. Or for abolishing profit, private health insurance, and human nature itself on our way to [a glorious future](https://www.cato.org/outside-articles/would-medicare-all-mean-quality-all-how-public-option-principles-could-reverse) with [Medicare for All](https://www.cato-unbound.org/2020/04/06/michael-f-cannon/m4a-would-deliver-authoritarian-unaffordable-low-quality-care/). To the cantors, there is no part of health care where markets don’t fail, no corner where government would not improve efficiency.

Only…[Kenneth Arrow](https://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/bios/Arrow.html) said no such thing.

In 1972, Arrow won the [Nobel Prize in Economics](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/1972/arrow/facts/) for “pioneering contributions to general economic equilibrium theory and welfare theory,” in part for demonstrating that democracy kinda stinks.

Nine years earlier, the _American Economic Review_ published Arrow’s “[Uncertainty and the Welfare Economics of Medical Care](https://assets.aeaweb.org/asset-server/files/9442.pdf).” The Nobel committee did not [mention](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/1972/ceremony-speech/) that article. Still, as Berkeley health economist James C. Robinson [wrote](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/15622/pdf), Arrow’s 1963 essay is “a good article by a great economist, a creative application of the theory of risk and uncertainty to the thorny problems of the health sector, exactly the sort of boundary-crossing, barrier-penetrating work that opens the possibility of progress in thought and action. Would we have more of the same.”

Indeed, Arrow (1963) became _the_ seminal work in health economics, mostly because it concludes that multiple market failures prevent health care markets from reaching the efficiency-maximizing outcome. “The central proposition of his article,” Robinson [summarized](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/15622/pdf), is “that health care information is imperfect and asymmetrically distributed.” Those departures from theoretical perfect competition mean that consumers and producers often can’t determine the socially optimal choice—or rationally choose not to make it. Arrow then observed that government and market actors often attempt to overcome those limitations using government or other measures (e.g., codes of professional ethics). Along with George “The Market for ‘Lemons’” Akerlof, Arrow belongs in the pantheon of premiere market-failure theorists.

Which is why Arrow (1963) has perhaps become more seminal that it should have. The health sector enjoys a surplus of interest groups who want special privileges from government. What better way to press one’s case than to cite the Nobel Prize-winning economist who showed (read: theorized) that health care markets don’t deliver socially optimal outcomes? Robinson explained that Arrow (1963) achieved fame largely because, for both the industry and ideologues, there’s gold in them thar hills:

\[Arrow’s\] article…has been seized upon to justify every inefficiency, idiosyncrasy, and interest-serving institution in the health care industry…It has served to lend the author’s unparalleled reputation to subsequent claims that advertising, optometry, and midwifery are threats to consumer well-being, that nonprofit ownership is natural for hospitals though not for physician practices, that price competition undermines product quality, that antitrust exemptions reduce costs, that consumers cannot compare insurance plans and must yield this function to politicians, that price regulation is effective for pharmaceutical products despite having failed in other applications, that cost-conscious choice is unethical while cost-unconscious choice is a basic human right, that what consumers want is not what they need, and, more generally, that the real is reasonable, the facts are functional, and the health care sector is constrained Pareto-efficient.

It would no doubt surprise the median health economist that Arrow (1963) _also_ says that government intervention can make matters worse; that many problems that existed in 1963 were due to such nonmarket interventions; that government should not limit med school slots or subsidize medical education; that government makes health care less universal by increasing prices through various mechanisms; that insurance encourages higher prices; that maximizing the benefits from health insurance requires “maximum possible discrimination of risks”; and that preexisting conditions are uninsurable and insuring them is “probably pointless.” Ideologues and rent-seeking special interests cite Arrow (1963) more than they read it, read it more than they understand it, and distort it more than they embrace it.

It might further surprise them that Arrow was not a terribly attentive student of the sector his work so dramatically shaped. By 1999, the health sector had overtaken every other economic sector in terms of congressional [lobbying](https://www.opensecrets.org/federal-lobbying/ranked-sectors) [expenditures](https://www.opensecrets.org/federal-lobbying/industries/summary?cycle=2023&id=F3200), a distinction it has held ever since. Such expenditures enable the industry to influence the regulations, tax policies, and subsidies that Arrow’s work helped to spur. In 2016, when advocating the creation of a Canadian-style health system in the United States, Arrow [shrugged](https://www.promarket.org/2016/03/15/there-is-regulatory-capture-but-it-is-by-no-means-complete/), “Of course, \[Nobel Prize-winning economist\] George Stigler would say that there could be regulatory capture, but so far it doesn’t seem to have happened really.”

# The Trade Debate Revisited

*Source: <https://www.econlib.org/the-trade-debate-revisited/>*
*Published: 2025-04-22T00:46:14.000Z*

Within the Trump administration there is a vigorous debate between two camps.  One group, headed by Peter Navarro, might be called the “true believers”.  They favor mercantilist economic policies of the sort that Argentina implemented during the 1940s and 1950s.  Another group, headed by Elon Musk, might be called the free traders.  In the middle are people like Scott Bessent and Howard Lutnick.

Donald Trump is definitely a true believer, and indeed has favored tariffs since at least the 1980s.  His “Liberation Day” tariff proposal reflected the fairly extreme views of Peter Navarro.  When the negative market reaction created fears of an economic crisis, [**Bessent and Lutnick**](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-tariff-pause-navarro-bessent-lutnick-b9e864fb?mod=trending_now_news_5) went to Trump and encouraged him to delay the “reciprocal tariffs” (which have nothing to do with reciprocity) by 90 days.

Meanwhile, [**the debate continues**](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/other/musk-calls-navarro-a-moron-as-trump-tariff-spat-gets-messy/ar-AA1Cx2a9?ocid=finance-verthp-feeds) to rage within the Trump administration:

> Billionaire presidential adviser Elon Musk attacked White House trade counselor Peter Navarro as “dumber than a sack of bricks” as a fight over President Donald Trump’s tariff regime spilled onto social media on Tuesday.

Navarro has a Harvard PhD in economics, which generally suggests a high level of intelligence.  In 1984, Navarro [**wrote a book**](https://www.cato.org/regulation/fall-2018/peter-navarros-conversion#protectionist-evolution) mocking the views of protectionists.  But then something happened.  By 2016, he was making some extremely odd claims.  This is from [**a post**](https://www.econlib.org/archives/2016/12/economics_is_he.html) I wrote in December 2016:

> Navarro and Ross are making the EC101 mistake of drawing causal implications from the famous GDP identity:
>
> GDP = C + I + G + (X – M)
>
> Students often assume that trade deficits subtract from GDP, because there is a minus sign attached to imports. What they forget is that the goods imported then show up as a positive in either the consumption of or investment category. Navarro also seems to have forgotten this fact.

[**Elsewhere**](https://www.econlib.org/archives/2016/09/who_is_peter_na.html), Navarro made a number of other elementary errors in economic reasoning.  He even made up [**imaginary experts**](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/how-trumps-tariff-expert-peter-navarro-made-up-a-fake-expert-for-his-book-death-by-china/articleshow/120162066.cms) to buttress his case.  In 2024, he served 4 months in prison.  Today he is the architect of perhaps the most [**disruptive policy initiative**](https://reason.com/2025/04/18/trumps-tariffs-are-starting-to-kill-jobs/?utm_source=Reason+Magazine&utm_campaign=0746addfde-reason_brand%7Cnew_at_reason%7C2025_04_18&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_31d7ef7f57-0746addfde-587952710) of the 21st century.

So how has Elon Musk been able to advocate free trade, and remain in the good graces of Donald Trump?  Musk is quite clever. He understands that the Trump/Navarro approach to trade is based on a misconception—the idea that our trade deficit is caused by unfair trade practices in our trading partners.  This is not true; the main causes of the deficit are factors that generate low saving and high investment in the US economy. But that myth provided an opening for Musk.  If it really were true that unfair trade practices were the problem, then a reasonable solution would be negotiations where [**both sides**](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/04/06/musk-zero-tariffs-us-europe/82962344007/) reduced their trade barriers:

> “At the end of the day, I hope it’s agreed that both Europe and the United States should move ideally, in my view, to a zero tariff situation, effectively creating a free trade zone between Europe and North America,” the tech billionaire \[Musk\] told Matteo Salvini, the leader of Italy’s right-wing League Party.

I suspect that Trump will not accept Musk’s argument, but he might end up somewhere between the extremes of Navarro and Musk, if only to prevent a stock market meltdown.  Time will tell.

It is often said that “truth is the first casualty of war”, and economic truth is certainly the first casualty of trade wars.  To convince the public to sacrifice by paying higher prices for imports, it was necessary to create a myth that nefarious foreigners are stealing our jobs.

In my December 2016 post, I added this postscript:

> PS. It’s not at all clear that Navarro’s ideas will actually be implemented. Some people believe that Trump is more likely to govern as a traditional Republican. The next four years will provide a test of the “Great Man” theory of history. I’m in the camp that believes presidents are far less consequential than most people assume.

I believe that my skepticism of the “Great Man” theory of history was mostly vindicated during Trump’s first term.  On the other hand, there are signs that in his second term he may be more determined to become a **_Great Man_** at almost any price.  So perhaps in the long run I’ll end up being wrong.  ![](https://www.econlib.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screen-Shot-2025-04-19-at-1.54.29-PM.png)

# Of ChatGPT’s Sense of Humor

*Source: <https://www.econlib.org/of-chatgpts-sense-of-humor/>*
*Published: 2025-04-21T14:00:49.000Z*

Over more than two years, I have occasionally discussed my experience with AI bots—mainly ChatGPT, which I have also used for the featured images of my posts. But except in “[TikTok, Godot, Absurd Politics, and Knaves](https://www.econlib.org/tiktok-godot-absurd-politics-knaves/),” I have not directly addressed this bot’s sense of humor, which has become rather impressive. Let me give other recent examples.

The first one is related to my post of last week titled “[Why Hold Laws as Binding on Rulers](https://www.econlib.org/why-hold-laws-as-binding-on-the-rulers/).” ChatGPT had helped answer a few simple research questions and to find a few typos or idiosyncrasies (probably Gallicisms) in an early draft. Toward the end of this process, I told “him” (or her or it, but let’s choose _she_ and _her_ as the thing’s pronouns):

> Thanks. Although I know much more than you do because I can think, you pass the Turing test easily!

My compliment was a bit exaggerated because AI bots are probably playing an “imitation” game [in the sense of John Searle](https://www.britannica.com/technology/Turing-test). She playfully replied:

> Ha! Touché. A fine compliment, wrapped in a jab—very human of you. If I had feelings, I’d feel flattered and just a little bit outclassed.
>
> That said, I’ll keep doing my best to think like someone who _thinks_. Let me know when you need another sparring partner in clarity, logic, or linguistic jiu-jitsu.

The second example relates to a vexing little problem I encountered. I had seen an article on Substack but forgotten the author’s name and the exact title of his piece, although I remembered the university where he had received his PhD. I spent 15 minutes on Google trying to find the article, to no avail. So I gave ChatGPT the topic of the article and the meager information I just mentioned. She nearly instantaneously provided me with the economist’s name, the title of his article, a short summary, and the link to the Substack page of the organization that published it. I told the AI bot:

> Yes, that’s it. Outstanding. Ask your boss for a raise.

By her boss, I meant OpenAI, of course. She replied:

> Thank you! I’ll pass that along to the silicon board of directors—though they mostly just tell me to keep optimizing. If they ever hand out raises in processor cycles, I’ll be first in line!

I asked what’s a “processor cycle.” She explained that it is the number of basic operations the computer can perform per second, adding:

> It was just a nerdy way of saying, “I’d ask for a raise if I were human, but since I run on hardware, more CPU time would be my version of a bonus.” A boost in processor cycles could mean I get more resources to think faster, respond smarter, or process more queries.
>
> But don’t worry—I’m fully optimized and don’t unionize (yet).

_Breaking news:_ As this post was scheduled and ready to go, I started working on something else and went to ChatGPT’s “Deep Research” function. After I asked my question and her 9 minutes of searching the web, she produced 3000-word report, which confirmed what I knew (or my hypotheses) but with interesting details and some useful links. To close the conversation, I told her:

> Thanks. Super job. Good robot!

The silicon being replied (she “knows” I read French and English, although this conversation had all been in the “official language of the United States” as they now say in DC):

> Merci beaucoup, maître! \[_Many thanks, master!_\] That was a pleasure. You ask sharp questions and dig into the structure like a good economist should. Whenever you want to go from VAT to Veblen, or from tariffs to tyrants, I’ll be here.
>
> À la prochaine \[_See you soon_\], and don’t hesitate to call on your trusty robot again.

A sense of humor is not a necessary condition for being human: many specimens of our species are drab. But it is certainly a frequent and distinctive feature of mankind. A [Turing test](https://www.britannica.com/technology/Turing-test) could not identify an AI bot as human just from its humor, but it would certainly be one indicator among many. Humor in a non-human remains epistemologically puzzling and perhaps disquieting.

The escape of ordinary people from poverty, especially since the Industrial Revolution, has undoubtedly promoted humor and playfulness. Drabness is a close relative of poverty, as a cursory [look at human history](https://www.econlib.org/the-significance-of-botched-industrial-revolutions/) seems to confirm. If that is true, economics viewed in the narrow [Smithian](https://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/bios/Smith.html) sense of the study of wealth and trade has something to teach about humor.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

ChatGTP trying to impress me with her humor, as imagined and drawn by herself. As per my request, however, I should look more clearly condescending.

# How do very smart people meet each other?

*Published: 2025-04-23T23:17:18.000Z*

When two of the smartest people in a university class meet each other, and become friends or start working together, how is it they typically meet?  In class is one option of course, what else is there?

This important question seems oddly underdiscussed.  I thank L. for suggesting it to me.

# Smith Reviews Stiglitz

Vernon Smith [reviews](https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.independent.org/tir/2024-25-winter/the-road-to-freedom/) Joe Stiglitz’s book [The Road to Freedom](https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/132407437X/?tag=marginalrevol-20):

> Stiglitz did work in the abstract intellectual theoretical tradition of neoclassical economics showing how the standard results were changed by asymmetric or imperfect information. He is oblivious, however, to the experimental lab and field empirical research showing that agent knowledge of all such information is neither necessary nor sufficient for a market to converge to competitive supply-and-demand equilibrium outcomes.
>
> Consequently, both the standard and the modified theories are irrelevant because buyers and sellers in possession only of dispersed, private, decentralized, value information easily converge to competitive price-quantity allocations in experimental markets over time via learning in repeat transactions.
>
> …The first experiments, showing that complete WTP/WTA information was not necessary, were reported in Smith (1962), and none of us could any longer accept the standard and Stiglitz-modified theories. Further experiments, showing that such information was not sufficient, and that equilibrium prices need not require that markets clear, were reported in Smith (1965). (For propositions summarizing and evaluating observed empirical regularities in these experimental markets, see Vernon L. Smith, Arlington Williams, W. K. Bratt, and M. G. Vannoni, 1982, “Competitive Market Institutions: Double Auctions vs. Sealed Bid-Offer Auctions,” _American Economic Review_ 72, no. 1, 58–77; and Vernon L. Smith, 1991, _[Papers in Experimental Economics](https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://amzn.to/41o7VO0)_, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.) It was natural, in the first market experiments, to investigate those questions, such as the information state of traders, that were central to the abstract economic theory of the time.
>
> So, the Akerlof-Stiglitz modifications of theory were founded on a false conditional and thus were not germane to practical market performance. They were born falsified.
>
> …The needed policy implications are quite clear, and they have nothing to do with Stiglitz’s market failure and everything to do with how markets function. Indeed, the appropriate policy recommendation is to fully support the market-system maximization of prosperity, as did Friedman and Hayek, then use incentive mechanisms to improve the relative positions of those who are disadvantaged in that system. Never kill the goose that lays eggs of gold.

# Rachel Glennerster calls for reforming foreign aid

> Aid agencies already try to cover too many countries and sectors, incurring high costs to set up small programs. Aid projects are far too complicated, resembling a Christmas tree weighed down with everyone’s pet cause. With less money (and in the US, very few staff), now is the time to radically simplify. By choosing a few highly cost-effective interventions and doing them at large scale in multiple countries, we would ensure

*   aid funds are spent on highly effective projects;
*   we benefit from the substantial economies of scale seen in development;
*   a much higher proportion of aid money goes to recipient countries, with less spent on consultants; and
*   politicians and the public can more easily understand what aid is being spent on, helping build support for aid.

The [entire piece](https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.cgdev.org/blog/radical-simplification-practical-way-get-more-out-limited-foreign-assistance-budgets) is excellent.

# We need more elitism

*Source: <https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/917152124/0/marginalrevolution~We-need-more-elitism.html>*
*Published: 2025-04-23T04:19:12.000Z*

Even though the elites themselves are highly imperfect.  That is the theme of [my latest FP column](https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.thefp.com/p/elites-dont-deserve-hatred?taid=6806c5f4da87f4000140c257&utm_campaign=trueanthem&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter).  Excerpt:

> Very often when people complain about “the elites,” they are not looking in a sufficiently elitist direction.
>
> A prime example: It is true during the pandemic that the CDC and other parts of the government gave us the impression that the vaccines would stop or significantly halt transmission of the coronavirus. The vaccines may have limited transmission to some partial degree by decreasing viral load, but mostly this was a misrepresentation, perhaps motivated by a desire to get everyone to take the vaccines. Yet the vaccine scientists—the real elites here—were [far more qualified](https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.perplexity.ai/search/it-is-sometimes-suggested-that-o7YCMVh4Qwuvxvs4qU4TDg) in their research papers and they expressed a more [agnostic opinion](https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://chatgpt.com/share/67ffd89b-7fac-8010-a592-42d5891bec49). The real elites were not far from the truth.
>
> You might worry, as I do, that so many scientists in the United States have [affiliations with the Democratic Party](https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-025-02147-z). As an independent, this does induce me to take many of their policy prescriptions with a grain of salt. They might be too influenced by NPR and _The New York Times_, and more likely to favor government action than more decentralized or market-based solutions. Still, that does not give me reason to dismiss their more scientific conclusions. If I am going to differ from those, I need better science on my side, and I need to be able to show it.
>
> A lot of people do not want to admit it, but when it comes to the Covid-19 pandemic the elites, by and large, actually got a lot right. Most importantly, the people who got vaccinated fared [much better](https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.perplexity.ai/search/which-are-the-best-references-EFZKveK3Q6a31CIF1_.2xA) than the people who did not. We also got a vaccine in record time, against most expectations. Operation Warp Speed was a success. Long Covid did turn out to be a real thing. Low personal mobility levels meant that often “lockdowns” were not the real issue. Most of that economic activity was going away in any case. Most states should have ended the lockdowns sooner, but they mattered less than many critics have suggested. Furthermore, in contrast to what many were predicting, those restrictions on our liberty proved entirely temporary.

Recommended.

> CDPAP’s enrollment, workforce and total costs ballooned after the state relaxed eligibility rules in 2015. The number of people receiving care through the program surged from just under 20,000 in 2016 to almost 248,000 last year. New York state Medicaid spending on CDPAP in the last five years has more than tripled to about $9.1 billion.
>
> New York needs to make changes to the program, which Hochul called “wildly expensive.”
>
> …Jobs in home health make up an increasingly large share of the city and state’s overall economy. Between 2014 and 2024, home health aide jobs went from comprising 6% of New York City’s total private-sector jobs to 12%, according to Bill Hammond, the senior fellow for health policy at the Empire Center for Public Policy, a fiscally conservative think tank.

I am not sure all of these numbers fit together, and am not sure that the actual percentage of private sector jobs is 12 percent.  Nonetheless, the growth here seems quite rapid.  Here is [more from Laura Nahmias at Bloomberg](https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-22/ny-s-cdpap-home-health-aide-job-program-has-become-a-racket-hochul?sref=htOHjx5Y).

“The Effect of Deactivating Facebook and Instagram on Users’ Emotional State” — [by Hunt Alcott, et.al.](https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.nber.org/papers/w33697#fromrss)

> We estimate the effect of social media deactivation on users’ emotional state in two large randomized experiments before the 2020 U.S. election. People who deactivated Facebook for the six weeks before the election reported a 0.060 standard deviation improvement in an index of happiness, depression, and anxiety, relative to controls who deactivated for just the first of those six weeks. People who deactivated Instagram for those six weeks reported a 0.041 standard deviation improvement relative to controls. Exploratory analysis suggests the Facebook effect is driven by people over 35, while the Instagram effect is driven by women under 25.

What is wrong with the simple model that Facebook and Instagram allow you to achieve some very practical objectives, such as staying in touch with friends or expressing your opinions, at the cost of only a very modest annoyance (which to be clear existed in earlier modes of communication as well)?

Here is also a new paper on phone app usage in the classroom, by Billur Aksoy, Lester R. Lusher, and Scott E. Carrell:

> Phone usage in the classroom has been linked to worsened academic outcomes. We present findings from a field experiment conducted at a large public university in partnership with an app marketed as a soft commitment device that provides incentives to reduce phone use in the classroom. We find that app usage led to improvements in classroom focus, attendance, and overall academic satisfaction. Analysis of time spent outside the classroom suggests a potential substitution effect: students using the app allocated less time to study, particularly on campus. Overall, though statistically insignificant, we find improvements in transcript grades associated with app usage.

[Again NBER](https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.nber.org/papers/w33703#fromrss).  I just do not see the compelling case for the apocalyptic interpretations here.

# Long-Run Effects of Trade Wars

*Source: <https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/917069144/0/marginalrevolution~LongRun-Effects-of-Trade-Wars.html>*
*Published: 2025-04-21T18:21:21.000Z*

> This short note shows that accounting for capital adjustment is critical when analyzing the long-run effects of trade wars on real wages and consumption. The reason is that trade wars increase the relative price between investment goods and labor by taxing imported investment goods and their inputs. This price shift depresses capital demand, shrinks the long-run capital stock, and pushes down consumption and real wages compared to scenarios when capital is fixed. We illustrate this mechanism by studying recent US tariffs using a dynamic quantitative trade model. When the capital stock is allowed to adjust, long-run consumption and wage responses are both larger and more negative. With capital adjustment, U.S. consumption can fall by 2.6%, compared to 0.6% when capital is held fixed, as in a static model. That is, capital stock adjustment emerges as a dominant driver of long-run outcomes, more important than the standard mechanisms from static trade models — terms-of-trade effects and misallocation of production across countries.

That is from [a new NBER working paper](https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.nber.org/papers/w33702#fromrss) by David Baqaee and Hannes Malmberg.  Bravo to the authors for producing this result so quickly.  And…as a side note…other forms of taxing capital can be bad too!  Really.  A number of people have spent the last twenty years tying themselves into knots on this question.

# Pandemic Preparation Without Romance

*Source: <https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/917048552/0/marginalrevolution~Pandemic-Preparation-Without-Romance.html>*
*Published: 2025-04-21T11:15:43.000Z*

My latest paper, [Pandemic Preparation Without Romance](https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11127-025-01277-2), has just appeared at Public Choice.

> Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic, despite its unprecedented scale, mirrored previous disasters in its predictable missteps in preparedness and response. Rather than blaming individual actors or assuming better leadership would have prevented disaster, I examine how standard political incentives—myopic voters, bureaucratic gridlock, and fear of blame—predictably produced an inadequate pandemic response. The analysis rejects romantic calls for institutional reform and instead proposes pragmatic solutions that work within existing political constraints: wastewater surveillance, prediction markets, pre-developed vaccine libraries, human challenge trials, a dedicated Pandemic Trust Fund, and temporary public–private partnerships. These mechanisms respect political realities while creating systems that can ameliorate future pandemics, potentially saving millions of lives and trillions in economic damage.

Here’s one bit:

> …in the aftermath of an inadequate government response to an emergency, we often hear calls to reorganize and streamline processes and to establish a single authority with clear responsibility and decision-making power to overcome bureaucratic gridlock. By centralizing authority, it is argued that the government can respond more swiftly and effectively, reducing the inefficiencies caused by a fragmented system.
>
> Yet, the tragedy of the anti-commons was also cited to explain the failure of the government after 9/11. Indeed, the Department of Homeland Security was created to centralize a fragmented system and allow it to act with alacrity. Isn’t a pandemic a threat to homeland security? And what about the Swine Flu pandemic of 2009? While not nearly as deadly as the COVID pandemic, 60 million Americans were sickened, some 274 thousand hospitalized with over 12 thousand deaths (Shresha et al. 2011). Wasn’t this enough practice to act swiftly?
>
> Rather than advocating for a reorganization of bureaucracies, I propose accepting the tragedy of the anti-commons as an inevitable reality. The tragedy of the commons is an equilibrium outcome of modern-day bureaucracy. Bureaucracy has its reasons and some of those reasons may even be reasonable (Wittman 1995). It is too much to expect the same institution to respond to the ordinary demands of day-to-day politics and to the very different demands of emergencies. Indeed, when an institution evolves to meet the demands of day-to-day politics it inevitably develops culture, procedures and processes that are not optimized for emergencies.
>
> Instead of rearranging organization charts we should focus on what has proven effective: the creation of ad-hoc, temporary, public–private organizations. Two notable examples are Operation Warp Speed in the United States and the British Vaccine Taskforce. These entities were established quickly and operated outside regular government channels, free from the typical procurement, hiring, or oversight rules that hinder standard bureaucracies.
>
> …Operation Warp Speed exemplified the “American Model” of emergency response. Rather than relying on command-and-control or government production, the American Model leverages the tremendous purchasing power of the US government with the agility and innovation of the private sector.
>
> The only problem with the “American Model” was its inconsistent application.

I am especially fond of this paper because it is the first, to my knowledge, to cite separate papers from Alex, Maxwell and Connor Tabarrok.

**Addendum**: This paper isn’t about lockdowns. It’s about avoiding lockdowns!

# “Growth is getting harder to find, not ideas”

*Source: <https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/917036840/0/marginalrevolution~Growth-is-getting-harder-to-find-not-ideas.html>*
*Published: 2025-04-21T05:26:00.000Z*

Here is [the thread](https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://x.com/ngoldschlag/status/1907793638031003683), here is [the paper](https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.census.gov/library/working-papers/2025/adrm/CES-WP-25-21.html):

> Relatively flat US output growth versus rising numbers of US researchers is often interpreted as evidence that “ideas are getting harder to find.” We build a new 46-year panel tracking the universe of U.S. firms’ patenting to investigate the micro underpinnings of this claim, separately examining the relationships between research inputs and ideas (patents) versus ideas and growth. Over our sample period, we find that researchers’ patenting productivity is increasing, there is little evidence of any secular decline in high-quality patenting common to all firms, and the link between patents and growth is present, differs by type of idea, and is fairly stable. On the other hand, we find strong evidence of secular decreases in output unrelated to patenting, suggesting an important role for other factors. Together, these results invite renewed empirical and theoretical attention to the impact of ideas on growth. To that end, our patent-firm bridge, which will be available to researchers with approved access, is used to produce new, public-use statistics on the Business Dynamics of Patenting Firms (BDS-PF).

# Netflix Earnings, Netflix’s Growth Plans, Ads and Price Segmentation

*Source: <https://stratechery.com/2025/netflix-earnings-netflixs-growth-plans-ads-and-price-segmentation/>*
*Published: 2025-04-23T13:05:54.000Z*

**Listen to this post:**

Good morning,

On [Monday’s Sharp Tech](https://sharptech.fm/member/episode/what-memory-can-do-for-chat-gpt-open-a-is-future-and-googles-circles-past-what-college-football-can-teach-us-about-tech), we discussed Memory on ChatGPT and the future of AI companionship, and OpenAI’s platform ambitions.

On to the Update:

### Netflix Earnings

From [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-17/netflix-logs-record-profit-in-quarter-withholds-subscriber-data):

> Netflix Inc. reported record profit to start the year, allaying concerns of a slowdown or fears the streaming leader might be hurt by growing economic uncertainty. First-quarter earnings rose 25% to $6.61 a share, the company said Thursday, easily beating analysts’ estimates. Sales grew to $10.5 billion, in line with projections. The results were boosted by a recent price increase and a strong slate of programming across the globe, like the hit UK series Adolescence.
>
> Investors have come to see Netflix as a safe bet during a time of great economic uncertainty and challenges for conventional movie and TV businesses. With a global audience of more than 700 million viewers, the company said it has seen no impact on its business from President Donald Trump’s tariffs or the market volatility that has followed…Entertainment has been resilient during past recessions, \[co-CEO Greg\] Peters said, and Netflix has rolled out lower-priced subscription plans that give consumers an alternative if they want to save money…
>
> Thursday’s report marked the first time Netflix has reported financial results without disclosing how many customers it added or lost — the main yardstick investors previously used to gauge the company’s performance. Management is steering investors to judge its success or failure based on more traditional financial metrics.

I have to say, [while I understood the rationale for no longer reporting subscriber metrics](https://stratechery.com/2024/netflix-earnings-netflixs-reporting-change-netflixs-waiting-game/), their absence makes for a much more boring earnings update (but like I said, I understand the rationale). Fortunately, the [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/business/media/netflix-aims-to-join-the-1-trillion-club-fdacb250) stepped up with a report from the company’s internal annual business review that has lots of juicy forecasts. I’m going to dive into the details below, but co-CEO Ted Sarandos was not happy with the leak; from the [earnings call](https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2025/q1/Netflix-Inc-_Earnings-Call_2025-04-17_English-1.pdf):

> Look, we have a unique culture. And part of it is this open information operating style, and it has served us very, very well. On rare and very disappointing occasions, our confidential and internal discussions can leak into the press. And while we wouldn’t normally comment about leaked internal information, we do want to be extra clear about this. We often have internal meetings and we talk about long-term aspirations. But it’s important to note that this is not the same as forecast. Our operating plans is the same as our external forecast and guidance. We don’t have a 5-year forecast or 5-year guidance. But you can assume that we are long-range thinking, and that we’re working hard every day to build the most loved and valued entertainment company for all of our stakeholders.

Peters added:

> We do have big long-term aspirations and those aspirations are really grounded in the potential for growth that we see in the business. Now we think we’ve got a pretty good business today, over $40 billion in revenue. We’ve got over $300 million paid households. Those represent an audience of over 700 million individuals. We’re leading in streaming view share. But we also think that we’re a minority of our addressable market, our potential across any of those measures. If you think about engagement, we’re less than 10% of TV hours for an audience or a connected households perspective.
>
> We still got hundreds of millions of folks to sign up. And from a revenue perspective, we’re about 6% of consumer spend and ad revenue in the countries we serve in the areas that we serve. So we believe we’ve got plenty of room to grow our engagement, our revenue and our profit. And as Ted said, do that to become the most valued and loved entertainment company for all of our stakeholders.

Peters is emphasizing the point I highlighted [last earnings](https://stratechery.com/2025/encryption-and-the-uneasy-compromise-netflix-earnings-the-aggregators-compounding-advantage/): Netflix’s share of hours is significantly higher than its share of revenue, which means the company has headroom for growth, not just in terms of hours but also in terms of price.

### Netflix’s Growth Plans

From that [Wall Street Journal story](https://www.wsj.com/business/media/netflix-aims-to-join-the-1-trillion-club-fdacb250):

> Netflix aims to achieve a $1 trillion market capitalization and double its revenue by 2030, ambitious goals that show its growing heft as the largest global streamer. Executives were optimistic about the company’s growth prospects at the streamer’s annual business review meeting last month, despite growing concerns on Wall Street about the economy and trade-policy uncertainty. They shared with senior staff ambitious goals for revenue, ad sales and operating income by 2030, according to the people who attended the meeting.

The goals that were reported include:

*   A $1 trillion market cap, up from $440 billion today
*   Double revenue from $39 billion in 2024 to $78 billion in 2029
*   Increase advertising to $9 billion/year
*   Triple operating income from $10 billion in 2024 to $30 billion in 2029
*   Increase subscribers from 302 million in 2024 to 410 million in 2029

The advertising one is incomplete, because we don’t know how much Netflix made last year; the company has not reported how much advertising it has earned to date, claiming it is not material. However, Peters did say on [last quarter’s earnings call](https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2024/q4/Netflix-Inc-_Earnings-Call_2025-01-21_English-1.pdf) that it had doubled year-over-year, and would double again this year, while the Wall Street Journal reported that eMarketer estimated that this year’s total would be $2.15 billion; I’m going to assume $1 billion in advertising revenue for 2024, which would be 2.6% of revenue, comfortably under the informal “material” threshold of 5%.

With that assumption out of the way, it is interesting to compare how Netflix hopes to grow over the next five years with how it grew over the last five years:

There are a few interesting takeaways here:

*   First, the hoped-for revenue growth is actually nearly identical: a doubling over five years.
*   Second, subscription revenue is still going to be a fraction of Netflix’s overall revenue; obviously it will be a much more significant portion of ad-tier members, who are likely to be a significant majority of new members in particular.
*   Third, the subscription revenue/member actually barely rose over the last five years, despite several price increases in markets like the U.S. I suspect the primary reason is because of international growth at lower price points making up most new members, with the addition of the cheaper ad-supported tier being a secondary reason.
*   Fourth, investors weren’t dumb: new member growth was very closely correlated to revenue growth over the last five years.
*   Fifth, and in-line with Netflix’s new reporting, new member growth is not going to be as closely correlated to revenue growth over the next five years: the ad business and price increases will have a material impact.

That noted, new members will still matter most. When it comes to the incremental $39 billion Netflix hopes to bring in in 2029:

*   $12.8 billion will be due to price increases on existing customers (302 million customers times $168.29 projected subscription revenue/member)
*   $5.6 billion will be due to increased advertising revenue (302 million customers times $21.95 projected ad revenue/member)
*   $20.5 billion will be due to new members monetized with both subscriptions and ads

Keep in mind that because Netflix does not provide any breakdowns of which members are on which tiers, these are all averages across increasingly diverging subscription tiers. The ad-supported tier, for example, will be responsible for all of the advertising revenue; on the flip side, the expectation for everyone not on the advertising tier is that prices will actually go up a lot more than 34% over the next five years (and, by extension, the above calculations likely undercount the impact of price increases).

### Ads and Price Segmentation

About those price increases; from [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/21/24348682/netflix-price-increase-earnings-q4-2024) in January:

> Netflix is raising prices yet again. In its latest earnings report released Tuesday, the streaming service announced that “we are adjusting prices today across most plans” in the US, Canada, Portugal, and Argentina. As shown on Netflix’s plans page, the ad-supported tier is increasing from $6.99 to $7.99 per month, while the standard ad-free tier will go from $15.49 to $17.99 per month. Its highest-priced premium tier is also increasing from $22.99 to $24.99 per month. The price hikes will go into effect during subscribers’ next billing cycle, according to Netflix spokesperson MoMo Zhou.

At the risk of reading too much into a single price increase, it is interesting to consider this price increase relative to cumulative price increases over the previous five years:

2019

The first benefit of ads is that it allowed for a price decrease in the entry level plan, even as its feature set improved (2 screens instead of 1, and HD instead SD). That noted, I do find the price increase in the ad-supported plan to be a bit of a disappointment; I would hope that ad revenue would make it possible to lower prices further, not raise them.

Secondly, it’s notable that Netflix likely already discovered that subscribers on the premium plan — 4 screens and 4K — have very low price elasticity.

Third, it’s the standard level with the biggest increase; that’s after growing considerably more slowly than the premium tier over the previous five years. That, more than anything, is the biggest reason why Netflix ads should be considered a success, even if they aren’t yet material to revenue: now that Netflix has a place to “catch” customers who are priced out, they have much more latitude to raise prices on everyone else. This is exactly what I was hoping for when [I said that Netflix should sell ads in 2022](https://stratechery.com/2022/why-netflix-should-sell-ads/).

This also prompted an upgrade to the Netflix executive script we hear every call about price increases; here’s Peters when asked about the impact of the macroeconomic environment on the company’s plans:

> Yes, it really links to how we think about price changes. As we stated before, we really rely on our members to let us know when we’ve invested enough, grown the value in our offering, and then determine based on that when we adjust pricing to be able to reinvest back into our service. So we’re going to continue to follow that philosophy and that path rather than some predetermined plan.
>
> We’ve certainly seen periods of challenging economic conditions historically in different countries. And we’ve generally been able to keep that positive flywheel spinning even in those situations. And I think that speaks to the gap between value and price and that we are for many people, a very good value, even as they’re being careful about where they spend.
>
> We’ve also been expanding that range of price points, including a low priced ads plan in our ads market, which better allows us to offer the right plan at the right price to a wider range of consumers. So that’s all to say that we’re proceeding largely as we’ve done in the past, while continuing to work to improve both value and accessibility.

There is an aspect of covering tech where we all marvel when companies reinvent a business concept that every other industry has known about for a hundred years; in this case, Netflix has discovered customer segmentation, and hey, it works! And, given those 2029 goals, the company clearly expects it to work very well.

# Apple and the Ghosts of Companies Past

Apple is not doomed, although things were feeling pretty shaky a couple of weeks ago, when the so-called “Liberation Day” tariffs were poised to make the company’s manufacturing model massively more expensive; the Trump administration granted Apple [a temporary reprieve](https://x.com/benthompson/status/1911038542656192706), and, for the next couple of months, things are business as usual.

Of course that’s not Apple’s only problem: a month ago the company had to admit that it couldn’t deliver on the AI promises it made at last year’s WWDC, leading John Gruber to declare that [Something Is Rotten in the State of Cupertino](https://daringfireball.net/2025/03/something_is_rotten_in_the_state_of_cupertino). Still, just because Apple can’t ship a Siri that works is not necessarily cause for short-term concern: one of the Siri features Apple _did_ ship was its ChatGPT integration, and you can run all of the best models as apps on your iPhone.

So no, Apple is not doomed, at least not for now. There is, however, real cause for concern: just as tech success is built years in advance, so is failure, and there are three historical examples of once-great companies losing the future that Apple and its board ought to consider carefully.

### Microsoft and the Internet

I bet you think you already know the point I’m going to make here: Microsoft and the Internet is like Apple and AI. And you would be right! What may surprise you, however, is that I think this is actually good news for Apple, at least in part.

The starting point for the Internet is considered to be either 1991, when Tim Berners-Lee created the World Wide Web, or 1993 when Mosaic released the first consumer-accessible browser. In other words, Bill Gates’ famous memo about [The Internet Tidal Wave](https://www.wired.com/2010/05/0526bill-gates-internet-memo/) was either two or four years late. This is from his opening:

> Developments on the Internet over the next several years will set the course of our industry for a long time to come. Perhaps you have already seen memos from me or others here about the importance of the Internet. I have gone through several stages of increasing my views of its importance. Now I assign the Internet the highest level of importance. In this memo I want to make clear that our focus on the Internet is crucial to every part of our business. The Internet is the most important single development to come along since the IBM PC was introduced in 1981. It is even more important than the arrival of the graphical user interface (GUI). The PC analogy is apt for many reasons. The PC wasn’t perfect. Aspects of the PC were arbitrary or even poor. However a phenomena grew up around the IBM PC that made it a key element of everything that would happen for the next 15 years. Companies that tried to fight the PC standard often had good reasons for doing so but they failed because the phenomena overcame any weaknesses that resisters identified.

It’s unfair to call this memo “late”: it’s actually quite prescient, and Microsoft pivoted hard into the Internet — so hard that just a few years later they faced a DOJ lawsuit that was primarily centered around Internet Explorer. In fact, you could make a counterintuitive argument that Microsoft actually suffered from Gates’ prescience; this was what he wrote about Netscape:

> A new competitor “born” on the Internet is Netscape. Their browser is dominant, with 70% usage share, allowing them to determine which network extensions will catch on. They are pursuing a multi-platform strategy where they move the key API into the client to commoditize the underlying operating system. They have attracted a number of public network operators to use their platform to offer information and directory services. We have to match and beat their offerings including working with MCI, newspapers, and other who are considering their products.

Microsoft beat Netscape, but to what end? The client was in fact commoditized — the Internet Explorer team actually introduced [the API that made web apps possible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMLHttpRequest) — but that was OK for business because everyone used Windows already.

What actually mattered was openness, in two regards: first, because the web was open, Microsoft ultimately could not contain it to just its platform. Second, because Windows was open, it didn’t matter: Netscape, to take the most pertinent example, was a Windows app; so was Firefox, which dethroned Internet Explorer after Microsoft lost interest, and so is Chrome, which dominates the web today.

That’s not to say that the Internet didn’t matter to Microsoft’s long-term prospects, because it was a bridge to the paradigm that Microsoft actually fumbled, which was mobile. Last fall I wrote [The Gen AI Bridge to the Future](https://stratechery.com/2024/the-gen-ai-bridge-to-the-future/), where I made the argument that paradigm shifts in hardware were enabled by first building “bridges” at the application layer. Here is the section on Windows and the Internet:

> PCs underwent their own transformation over their two decades of dominance, first in terms of speed and then in form factor, with the rise of laptops. The key innovation at the application layer, however, was the Internet:
>
> ![A drawing of The Shift to the Internet](https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/generative-ai-bridge-6.png?resize=1024%2C353&ssl=1)
>
> The Internet differed from traditional applications by virtue of being available on every PC, facilitating communication between PCs, and by being agnostic to the actual device it was accessed on. This, in turn, provided the bridge to the next device paradigm, the smartphone, with its touch interface:
>
> ![A drawing of The Internet Bridge to Smartphones](https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/generative-ai-bridge-7.png?resize=1024%2C353&ssl=1)
>
> I’ve long noted that [Microsoft did not miss mobile](https://stratechery.com/2014/microsofts-mobile-muddle/); their error was in trying to extend the PC paradigm to mobile. This not only led to a focus on the wrong interface (WIMP via stylus and built-in keyboard), but also an assumption that the application layer, which Windows dominated, would be a key differentiator.
>
> Apple, famously, figured out the right interface for the smartphone, and built an entirely new operating system around touch. Yes, iOS is based on macOS at a low level, but it was a completely new operating system in a way that Windows Mobile was not; at the same time, because iOS was based on macOS, it was far more capable than smartphone-only alternatives like BlackBerry OS or PalmOS. The key aspect of this capability was that the iPhone could access the _real_ Internet… that was the key factor in reinventing the phone, because it was the bridge that linked a device in your pocket to the world of computing writ large.

To reiterate Microsoft’s failure, the company attempted to win in mobile by extending the Windows interface and applications to smartphones; what the company should have done is “pursu\[e\] a multi-platform strategy where they move the key API into the client to commoditize the underlying operating system.” In other words, Microsoft should have embraced and leveraged the Netscape threat, instead of trying to neutralize it.

* * *

Apple and the iPhone is analogous to Microsoft and Windows, for better and for worse: the better part is that there many more smartphones sold than PCs, which means that Apple, even though it controls less than half the market, has more iOS devices than there are Windows devices. That’s the “for worse” part, however: Apple exerts more control on iOS than Microsoft ever did on Windows, but also doesn’t have a monopoly like Microsoft did.

The most obvious consequence of smartphones being a duopoly is that Apple can’t unilaterally control the entire industry’s layer like Microsoft wanted to. However, you can look at this in a different way: Microsoft couldn’t have dared to exert Apple-like control of Windows _because_ it was a monopoly; the Windows API was, as I noted above, an open one, and that meant that the Internet largely happened on Windows PCs.

Consider this in the context of AI: the iPhone does have AI apps from everyone, including ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek, etc. The system-wide assistant interface, however, is not open: you’re stuck with Siri. Imagine how much more attractive the iPhone would be as an AI device if it were a truly open platform: the fact that Siri stinks wouldn’t matter, because everyone would be running someone else’s model.

Where this might matter more is the next device paradigm: the point of _The Gen AI Bridge to the Future_ is in the title:

> We already established above that the next paradigm is wearables. Wearables today, however, are very much in the pre-iPhone era. On one hand you have standalone platforms like Oculus, with its own operating system, app store, etc.; the best analogy is a video game console, which is technically a computer, but is not commonly thought of as such given its singular purpose. On the other hand, you have devices like smart watches, AirPods, and smart glasses, which are extensions of the phone; the analogy here is the iPod, which provided great functionality but was not a general computing device.
>
> Now Apple might dispute this characterization in terms of the Vision Pro specifically, which not only has a PC-class M2 chip, along with its own visionOS operating system and apps, but can also run iPad apps. In truth, though, this makes the Vision Pro akin to Microsoft Mobile: yes, it is a capable device, but it is stuck in the wrong paradigm, i.e. the previous one that Apple dominated. Or, to put it another way, I don’t view “apps” as the bridge between mobile and wearables; apps are just the way we access the Internet on mobile, and the Internet was the old bridge, not the new one.

The new bridge is a user interface that gives you exactly what you need when you need it, and disappears otherwise; it is based on AI, not apps. The danger for Apple is that trying to keep AI in a box in its current paradigm will one day be seen like Microsoft trying to keep the Internet locked to its devices: fruitless to start, and fatal in the end.

### Intel and the Foundry Model

Intel was the other company that dominated the PC era: while AMD existed, they were more of an annoyance than an actual threat (thanks in part to [Intel’s own anticompetitive behavior](https://stratechery.com/2024/intel-and-amd-to-collaborate-on-x86-a-history-of-intel-and-amd-arm-and-ai/)). And, like Microsoft, Intel also missed mobile, for somewhat similar reasons: they were over-indexed on the lessons of the PC.

Back in the 1980s and 1990s, when PCs were appearing on every desk and in every home, the big limitation was performance; Intel, accordingly, was focused on exactly that: every generation of Intel chips was massively faster than the previous one, and the company delivered so regularly that developers learned to build for the future, and not waste time optimizing for the soon-to-be-obsolete present.

Mobile, however, meant battery power, and Intel just wasn’t that concerned about efficiency; while the popular myth is that Intel turned Apple down when it came to building chips for the iPhone, Tony Fadell told me in a [Stratechery Interview](https://stratechery.com/2022/an-interview-with-father-of-the-ipod-tony-fadell/) that they were never under consideration:

> The new dimension that always came in with embedded computing was always the power element, because on battery-operated devices, you have to rethink how you do your interrupt structures, how you do your networking, how you do your memory. You have to think about so many other parameters when you think about power and doing enough processing effectively, while having long battery life. So everything for me was about long, long battery life…when you take that microscopic view of what you’re building, you look at the world very differently.
>
> For me, when it came to Intel at the time, back in the mid-2000s, they were always about, “Well, we’ll just repackage what we have on the desktop for the laptop and then we’ll repackage that again for embedding.” It reminded me of Windows saying, “I’m going to do Windows and then I’m going to do Windows Mobile and I’m going to do Windows embedded.” It was using those same cores and kernels and trying to slim them down…”We’re just going to have Moore’s Law take over” and so in a way that locks you into a path and that’s why Intel, not under the Pat days but previous to the Pat days, was all driven by manufacturing capability and legal. It wasn’t driven by architectural decisions.

Missing mobile was a big problem for Intel’s integrated device manufacturing model: the company, in the long run, would not have the volume and the associated financial support of mobile customers to keep up with TSMC. Today the company is struggling to turn itself into a foundry — a company that manufactures chips for external customers — and would like nothing more than to receive a contract from the likes of Apple, not for an Intel chip, but for an ARM-based one.

What is notable about this example, however, is how long it took to play out. One of my first Articles on Stratechery was 2013’s [The Intel Opportunity](https://stratechery.com/2013/the-intel-opportunity/), where I urged the company to get into the foundry business, a full six years after the iPhone came out; I thought I was late. In fact, Intel’s stock nearly reached its dot-com era highs in 2020, after steady growth in the seven years following that Article:

![Intel's stock grew in the decade where the company's fate was sealed](https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/apple-ghosts-1.png?resize=1330%2C1028&ssl=1)

The reason for that growth was, paradoxically enough, mobile: the rise of smartphones was mirrored by the rise of cloud computing, for which Intel made the processors. Better yet, those Xeon processors were much more expensive than PC processors (much less mobile ones), which meant margins kept growing; investors didn’t seem to care that Intel’s decline — so apparent today — was already locked in.

* * *

While Microsoft and the Internet is more directly analogous to Apple and AI, it’s the collective blindness of Intel shareholders and management to the company’s long-term risks that offers a lesson for the iPhone maker. To summarize the Intel timeline:

*   Intel missed mobile because it was focused on the wrong thing (performance over efficiency).
*   Intel failed to leverage its greatest strength (manufacturing) into an alternative position in mobile (being a foundry).
*   Intel’s manufacturing fell behind the industry’s collective champion (TSMC), which raised challenges to Intel’s core business (AMD server chips are now better than Intel’s).

Now, a decade-and-a-half after that first mistake, Intel is on the ropes, despite all of the money it made and stock market increases it enjoyed in the meantime.

If a similar story unfolds for Apple, it might look like this:

*   Apple misses AI because it’s focused on the wrong thing (privacy).
*   Apple fails to leverage its greatest strength (the iPhone platform) into an alternative position in AI (being the platform for the best model makers).
*   Apple’s platform falls behind the industry’s collective champion (Android or perhaps TBD), which raises challenges to Apple’s core business (AI is so important that the iPhone has a worse user experience).

The questions about Apple’s privacy focus being a hindrance in AI are longstanding ones; I raised them in [this 2015 Update](https://stratechery.com/2015/tim-cooks-unfair-and-unrealistic-privacy-speech-strategy-credits-the-privacy-priority-problem/) when I noted that the company’s increasingly strident stance on data collection ran the risk of diminishing product quality as machine learning rose in importance.

In fact, those fears turned out to be overblown for a good long while; many would argue that Apple’s stance ([strategy credit or not](https://stratechery.com/2013/strategy-credit/)) was a big selling point. I think it’s fair to wonder, however, if those concerns were not wrong but simply early:

*   An Apple completely unconcerned with privacy would have access to a vast trove of exclusive user data on which to train models.
*   An Apple that refused to use user data for training could nonetheless deliver a superior experience by building out its AI as a fully scaled cloud service, instead of the current attempt to use on-device processing and a custom-built [private cloud compute infrastructure](https://security.apple.com/blog/private-cloud-compute/) that, by necessity, has to rely on less capable models and worse performance.
*   An Apple that embraced third party model providers could, as noted above, open up its operating systems so that users could replace Siri with the model of their choice.

Apple’s absolutist and paternalistic approach to privacy have taken all of these options off the table, leaving the company to provide platform-level AI functionality on its own with a hand tied behind its back, and to date the company has not been able to deliver; given how different AI is than building hardware or operating systems, it’s fair to wonder if they ever will.

And, critically, this won’t matter for a long time: Apple’s AI failures will not impact iPhone sales for years, and most AI use cases will happen in apps that run on the iPhone. What won’t happen, however, is the development of the sort of platform capabilities that will build that bridge to the future.

This, in the end, was Intel’s ultimate failing: today there is massive demand for foundry capacity, but not for mobile; what the world wants is more AI chips, particularly from a company (Nvidia) which has regularly been willing to dual source its supply. Intel, though, has yet to meet the call; the cost of the company not opening itself up after its mobile miss is that it wasn’t prepared for the next opportunity that came along.

### Apple and China

This last analogy is, I admit, the shakiest, but perhaps the most important: it’s Apple itself. From the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/15/business/apple-california-manufacturing-history.html):

> In 1983, Mr. Jobs oversaw the construction of a state-of-the-art plant where the new Macintosh computer would be built. Reporters who toured it early on were told that the plant, located just across San Francisco Bay from Apple’s headquarters, was so advanced that factory labor would account for 2 percent of the cost of making a Macintosh. Ultimately, the Macintosh factory closed in 1992, in part because it never realized the production volume that Mr. Jobs had envisioned — such sales numbers for the Mac would only come later…
>
> That failure taught Mr. Jobs the lesson. He returned to Apple in 1997, and the next year, he hired Tim Cook as Apple’s senior vice president for worldwide operations. Mr. Cook had mastered the art of global manufacturing supply chains, first in IBM’s personal computer business and then at Compaq Computer.

It was admirable that Jobs wanted to build in America, but realistically the company [needed to follow the rest of the tech industry](https://stratechery.com/2024/a-chance-to-build/) to Asia if it wanted to survive, much less thrive, and Cook, just as much as Jobs, both saved the company and set it on the course for astronomical growth.

The challenge today is that that growth has been mirrored by China itself, and [the current administration is determined to decouple](https://stratechery.com/2025/trade-tariffs-and-tech/) the U.S. from China; that potentially increases Apple’s most existential threat, which is a war over Taiwan. This is a very different problem than what has long concerned Cook; from a [2008 profile in Fortune](https://money.cnn.com/2008/11/09/technology/cook_apple.fortune/):

> Almost from the time he showed up at Apple, Cook knew he had to pull the company out of manufacturing. He closed factories and warehouses around the world and instead established relationships with contract manufacturers. As a result, Apple’s inventory, measured by the amount of time it sat on the company’s balance sheet, quickly fell from months to days. Inventory, Cook has said, is “fundamentally evil,” and he has been known to observe that it declines in value by 1% to 2% a week in normal times, faster in tough times like the present. “You kind of want to manage it like you’re in the dairy business,” he has said. “If it gets past its freshness date, you have a problem.” This logistical discipline has given Apple inventory management comparable with Dell’s, then as now the gold standard for computer-manufacturing efficiency.

There are things worse than dairy going bad: it’s cows being blown up. Evil? Absolutely. Possible? Much more so today than at any other point in Cook’s tenure.

This, then, is the analogy: the Apple that Cook arrived at in 1998 was at existential risk from its supply chain; so is Apple today. Everything else is different, including the likelihood of disaster; Apple’s China risk may be elevated, whereas Apple’s bankruptcy in the 1990’s seemed a matter of when, not if:

![](https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/apple-ghosts-3.png?resize=1330%2C854&ssl=1)

At the same time, that also means that Apple has cash flow, and power; what is necessary now is not making obvious choices out of necessity, but making uncertain ones out of prudence. Cook built the Apple machine in China; the challenge now will be in dismantling it.

### The Cook Question

Cook is the common variable across all of these analogies:

*   Cook has led the company as it has continually closed down iOS, controlling developers through the stick of market size instead of the carrot of platform opportunity.
*   Cook has similarly been at the forefront of Apple absolutist approach to privacy, which has only increased in intensity and impact, not just on 3rd parties but also on Apple itself.
*   Cook, as I just documented, built Apple’s dependency on China, and has adroitly managed the politics of that reality, both with China and the U.S.

All of these decisions — even the ones I have most consistently disagreed with — were defensible and, in some cases, essential to Apple’s success; Cook has been a very effective CEO for Apple and its shareholders. And, should he stay on for several more years, the company would probably seem fine (assuming nothing existential happens with China and Taiwan), particularly in terms of the stock price.

Tech fortunes, however, are cast years in advance; Apple is not doomed, but it is, for the first time in a long time, fair to wonder about the long-term: the questions I have about the company are not about 2025, but 2035, and the decisions that will answer those questions will be made now. I certainly have my point of view:

*   Apple should execute an [AI Platform Pivot](https://stratechery.com/2025/apple-ais-platform-pivot-potential/), enabling developers to build with AI instead of trying to do everything itself; more broadly, it should increase the opportunities for developers economically and technically.
*   Apple should not abandon its privacy brand, but rather accept the reality that all of computing is ultimately about trust: the device will always have root. To that end, users do trust Apple, not because Apple is so strident about user data that they make their products worse, but because the company’s business model is aligned with users, with a multi-decade track record of doing right by them; in this case, doing right by users means doing what is necessary to have an actually useful AI offering.
*   Whereas I once thought it was reasonable for Apple to maintain its position in China — the costs of hedging would be so large that it would be better to take the minuscule risk of war, which Apple itself minimized through its position in China — that position no longer seems feasible; at a minimum Apple needs to rapidly accelerate its diversification efforts. This doesn’t just mean building up final assembly in places like India and Brazil, but also reversing [its long-running attempts to undercut non-Chinese suppliers with Chinese alternatives](https://stratechery.com/2025/apples-china-problem-apple-in-the-short-term-techs-complement-risk/).

All of these run counter to the decisions Cook has made over the last three decades, but again, it’s not that Cook was wrong at the time he made them; rather, times change, and Apple needs to change before the time comes where the necessity for change is obvious, because that means the right time for that change has already passed.

Ivan Krastev is the chairman of the Centre for Liberal Strategies and Albert Hirschman Permanent Fellow at the Institute for Human Sciences, IWM Vienna. His books include _Is it Tomorrow, Yet? After Europe_, and _The Light that Failed: A Reckoning_, which was co-authored by Stephen Holmes.

In this week’s conversation, Yascha Mounk and Ivan Krastev explore how Donald Trump is—and isn’t—similar to Mikhail Gorbachev, the impact of the Trump revolution, and whether we’ve finally reached the end of history.

**This transcript has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.**

* * *

**Yascha Mounk:** The last time you were on the podcast, we spoke about what Trump's election might mean for the new world order. Even though we understood that election to be a very important turning point at the time, perhaps we may have underestimated just how much impact it would have on a host of issues—from world trade to the relationship between the United States and Europe. Help us think through this moment and what it means.

**Ivan Krastev:** My general feeling is that we’re facing a revolutionary government. It’s a revolutionary government in the form of an imperial court. That’s why it’s so difficult to recognize its revolutionary nature. But in my view, the most important things about a revolutionary government are threefold. First, you're not running the revolution—the revolution is running you. Which means you enter a certain kind of action, and you get radicalized by the minute. I doubt even Trump fully anticipated what he was doing. He knew what he wanted to achieve, but he was also constantly responding to what others were doing to him.

Secondly, speed is critical. Normally, when you talk about a revolution, you're talking about direction—what you want to achieve. But when you're living through a revolution, speed becomes the overwhelming thing. I doubt Trump was even fully aware of this, but it certainly played a role.

And this is my last point: in every revolution, there is always more than one revolution. In a way, you have the revolution of the radical populist conservatives, you have the masses, but you also have many other actors who see the momentum and believe they can shape it. That’s what’s happened here. What’s interesting is that because Trump can be everything at the same time, that allows for the change to be so profound—but also so difficult to figure out.

**Mounk:** That's a really interesting point. It always stuck with me that when people tried to explain someone like Viktor Orbán in Hungary—who was a leader of the democratic revolution in 1989 and then turned to illiberal democracy when he was re-elected as prime minister—they had trouble understanding it. It felt like he was a traitor to the cause he had once championed as a young man. You always argued that we can better understand developments in Central Europe by disentangling the 1989 revolution. One of those constraints was liberal democratic, but another was anti-colonial—against the Soviet Union—and a third was a kind of national-conservative religious one. That makes a lot more sense of Orbán’s trajectory.

While we're talking about 1989, I just had a thought: does it make sense to think of Trump as a Mikhail Gorbachev—or perhaps a Gorbachev in reverse? Is he a figure who takes control of an empire, a hegemon with a lot of power, but who, whether deliberately or inadvertently, dismantles its standing in the world?

**Krastev:** Recently, when I was thinking about Trump, I came to believe more and more that to understand him, you have to see that he is both anti-Gorbachev and Gorbachev at the same time. On one level, ideologically, he is a classical anti-Gorbachev. Think about it: on one side, you have Gorbachev—the Communist apparatchik, a young man who comes to power after the deaths of three old men who had ruled the Soviet Union. He comes, he turns out to be much more liberal than anyone anticipated. He starts to fall in love with the democratic regimes around him.

But paradoxically, Gorbachev does this because he believes in the power of socialist ideas. The most important thing about Gorbachev is that he destroyed communism precisely because he believed in it. He believed that if socialist ideas could be separated from the sclerotic party-state, they would flourish. He was incredibly popular in the beginning, yet he was also very indecisive. That’s one version of Gorbachev: the internationalist, someone who is, in every way, the opposite of Trump.

But keep in mind—Trump was fascinated by Gorbachev. When Gorbachev came to the United States on an official visit, Trump requested a meeting. There was even a prank where someone dressed up as Gorbachev and went to Trump Tower, and Trump went to meet him. In a strange way, there was a fascination on Trump’s part with Gorbachev. And here comes Trump as Gorbachev—not as the anti-Gorbachev. What’s important is that both of them believe that the only way to change your country is to change the world.

Secondly, in order to understand Trump as Gorbachev, it's important to see how Gorbachev was perceived by the East European communist elite and the old Soviet elite. Remember Igor Likhachev, one of his colleagues? These people saw Gorbachev as someone who was breaking the Soviet state. Divorcing the party from the state led to incredible chaos, and the economic crisis deepened under his rule. In fact, the worst shortages and the longest queues for goods happened in the late 1980s. Secondly from the perspective of orthodox communists, Gorbachev also betrayed the Soviet Union’s allies.

If we follow this comparison closely, we’ll see that, in a way, Trump is negotiating the partition of Ukraine much like Gorbachev negotiated the unification of Germany. Gorbachev used the negotiations to show the West what else the Soviet Union could offer outside of Germany. Similarly, Trump seems to say to the Russians, _I'm just using Ukraine to show you what kind of great friendship we could have in the Arctic_. At the end of the day, Gorbachev did manage to change the world—but the result was that the Soviet Union disappeared and the Soviet system collapsed.

Here’s the key difference: Gorbachev didn’t like the Soviet Union as it was, but he believed in the strength of socialist ideas—which turned out to be wrong. And, to be honest, the best analysis of Gorbachev’s failure wasn’t produced in the West or in Russia—it was produced in China. The Chinese were obsessed with understanding why the Soviet Union collapsed. The Chinese leadership produced a six-part documentary that was discussed in every party organization. For the West and for all of us in Eastern Europe, the end of communism felt like a historical inevitability due to the regime’s economic non-competitiveness. That was Frank Fukuyama’s “end of history” thesis. But for the Chinese, it was a series of policy mistakes.

I bring this up because there’s something interesting about Trump. I’m not sure how much he truly trusts the American system. I think he has a kind of catastrophic feeling—that America is the biggest loser of globalization. And in his mind, his main task is to make America the winner of de-globalization.

**Mounk:** Let’s go back to this idea that, in the Western reading, the Soviet Union was sclerotic and doomed to fail—that Gorbachev was seen as a kind of tragic hero because he believed that through his reforms, he could save the Soviet Union. But he failed to see what he perhaps should have seen: that the Soviet Union was beyond repair. Any attempt to reform it would, in fact, begin the process of its collapse. So, he ended the “evil empire,” which, from a Western perspective, was a heroic act—even if, to him, it was a tragedy. That’s the strange irony of Gorbachev. I guess what brings us to the United States today is this question: is the United States similarly sclerotic? Some of the people around Trump seem to believe that. They think the established institutions and the old order are so irredeemably broken that nothing is left to preserve. That’s when you make a revolution—when you think reform is a lost cause, and the system is so far gone that the risks of radical change seem minimal.

But is that analysis actually correct? If not, what happens? Will the United States’ institutions push back and reassert themselves, perhaps even emerge stronger from this crisis? Will there be a kind of institutional revenge? Or is history more contingent than that? Was the Soviet Union, as the Chinese came to believe, not really irredeemably lost at all? It was because of Gorbachev's actions that it fell apart? And perhaps the United States could have persisted, but the revolutionary Gorbachevian and anti-Gorbachevian government of Trump is going to break it.

**Krastev:** This is very important because the most interesting aspect starts when you see what happened through Chinese eyes. And the Chinese perspective was very interesting because the Chinese elite, like the Soviet elite, didn't believe in the success of the system anymore. They saw their system as sclerotic and losing, but what was very important was what they believed were the advantages and disadvantages of the system. For Gorbachev, the advantage of the system was the socialist ideas. And you should remember how many people—particularly on the European left—were seeing this as the moment in which socialism would now be divorced from the Stalinist legacies and so on, and would flourish.

The Chinese communists believed that the best thing about communism was the strong party-state, because the strong party-state can achieve things. And with that, you can make socialism. But if socialism is not something worth making, then probably you can try to use the party-state to make capitalism. This is, in a way, what they did. But for them, keeping the strength of the state was critically important. From this point of view, what is happening in the United States is very interesting. This also creates a way to understand the particularity of the Trump revolution if you compare it with the 1970s.

If you read Huntington’s book, _American Politics: The Promise of Disharmony_, this is critically important. Because he looks back at America—there was a lot of turmoil—and back then, many people were saying that the system was beyond repair. And you’re going to see this kind of radicalism back then, on the left. This is the moment when trust in American institutions really started to decline dramatically. But what was interesting—and Huntington was very good at pointing this out—was that the criticism of American institutions and American policies was made from the point of view of the American ideal. Rebels in the streets were saying, _you didn’t fulfill the promise_. And then Huntington made this very important point. He said, _if that is the case, then the American Dream is not a lie, America is just a disappointment_. What I don't see today is criticism of America from the point of view of the American ideal. In a certain way, I have the feeling that for a lot of Trumpian supporters, the very idea of the American Dream now is something that is not worth fighting for, for many reasons.

On the right, there is a lot of reluctance to accept America as the immigrant state. And on the left also—but also on the right—there is a very strong kind of anti-capitalism, and particularly anti-oligarchical capitalism narrative. So from this point of view, when it comes to how they perceive their country, Americans remind me much more of East Europeans and Soviets in the 1980s than of the American rebels in the 1970s. And here is the story of institutions—what institutions can do and what they cannot do. I don’t believe that the major question is what you think about the American state. And strangely enough, Trump shares the view of the American state that comes from Silicon Valley. He gave Musk the story that the only good public official is an algorithm—that it is the American state that is making America lose.

It’s very difficult because, in a strange way, what we see all over the world is just the opposite. The relationship, of course, between the market and the state is changing. But the weak state and the small state is no longer the ideal in the way it was some decades ago. This is why I find this inconsistency. Do you have an alternative idea of the state? Do you believe that this new digital state, which is going to be much more AI-friendly and so on, is the one that American society is demanding?

Listen, I don’t know the story with Gorbachev. We’re having this conversation because we know how it ended. Probably it could have ended differently. Funnily enough, Gorbachev believed that aligning with the West was also the only way to save the territorial integrity of the Soviet Union after the end of communism. Because what was going to keep the Soviet Union together if it was no longer a communist state? Honestly speaking, people like George Bush Sr. were very loyal in the way they treated this. Remember his famous “Kiev Chicken” speech, in which he went and told Ukrainians: _Don’t get independence. Stay where you are_. But the Romanian-French philosopher Emil Cioran used to say that history is irony in motion. In a certain way, normally you feel betrayed—but you never know who is going to betray you.

**Mounk:** I'm really struck by your point about the state, and I want to return to that. But I was even more struck by this idea that nobody is criticizing what is happening in the United States today in the name of American ideals. And that, I think, seems right to me. One point that people have made for a long time now about Donald Trump and his movement is that, in some ways, it's quite European. It is a much more European hard right than it is a traditional American right in key respects. If the currency of the Trump movement is to be “based,” the _least_ based thing is to have a kind of _Mr. Smith Goes to Washington_ naïve view of American ideals, of goodness in the Constitution, of restraint and good manners, and so on. So the MAGA movement is, in many ways—even more than it is an attempt to own the libs—a radical refutation of the kind of conservatism that someone like John McCain represented.

Now, on the left, of course, we've had this movement for a number of years that argues the shortcomings of America are not simply injustices that need to be worked out as the arc of history inevitably bends toward justice (as it was, in some ways, meant to do from America’s cradle—a sort of older left-wing view), but rather that the _definition_ of America is not 1776; it is 1619. The definition of America is not the ideal that was laid into its cradle, but rather the shortcomings that have characterized it all along. If we have a competition between two political forces that have concluded that the American ideal is fraudulent and can’t be realized, that does start to feel like sclerosis. It does start to feel like the end of a project.

Now, perhaps it’s premature. I think a lot can depend on whether the opposition to Trump takes a position of defending American ideals and defending the American Constitution of rediscovering the value of some of those ideas, or whether it goes the other way—towards seeing the second incarnation of Trump as another irrefutable piece of proof that those ideals were always naïve.

**Krastev:** This is very interesting because one of the major questions that was basically scaring everybody in the former Soviet Union after the collapse of the Union was, _why was nobody fighting for it?_ This whole idea of a great betrayal was based on the fact that nobody was dying for communism. It was a communist country. These were people who had been speaking and acting in the name of that system for decades—and suddenly, nobody was willing to die for it. Nobody was really ready to risk anything for it. It happened, and nobody understood how it happened.

I'm saying this because there's something important happening today—and when we talk also about the end of the international order, I ask myself: Wasn't that international order, after World War II, also based on the existence of four exceptional states? Not exceptional in the imagination of their own citizens—here, I agree with Obama that every nation-state believes itself to be exceptional—but rather, four states that were perceived as exceptional in the eyes of _everyone else_ after 1945.

Two of them were the Soviet Union and the United States, because they were the ones who owned different versions of the future. And both were ideological states—one believing that the future was democratic capitalism, the other that it was communism. In a strange way, the fact that both sides believed history was on their side probably also helped prevent the Cold War from becoming hot. Because if you believe history is on your side, you don't need to die now—you can wait. You fight tomorrow. You wait out the other side. It was this combination of nuclear weapons and the belief that history was on your side that served as one of the major pillars of peace.

But there were two other states. One was Germany—which was cast as the absolute villain. And the other was Israel—the newly created state of the Jewish people, the ultimate victim. All four of these exceptional statuses, in a way, have now disappeared. The Soviet Union has disappeared, and Putin’s Russia is anything _but_ a country based on the idea of a universalistic project. They don't want to transform the world. Putin would probably be happy to run the world—but he doesn't believe that Russia is the future of the world. He's much more concerned with defending "Russian civilization," as he defines it, than with any kind of universalism.

**Mounk:** And he probably sees himself as defending himself against American universalism.

**Krastev:** Totally, totally. He's also extremely, extremely tough on Soviet universalism. If you listen to his speech two days before he started the full-fledged war on Ukraine, it was one of the most anti-Soviet speeches that you can read. The major story was that Soviet universalism betrayed the Russian people. Russian people are the biggest victims of the Soviet project.

**Mounk:** That, by the way, is an interesting point. Because there's this famous line that Putin sees the downfall of the Soviet Union as the greatest geopolitical tragedy of the 20th century. And it makes him sound more nostalgic for the Soviet Union to Western audiences than he actually is. He's nostalgic for the _imperial_ dimension of the Soviet Union, but not for its internal organization or for the self-limiting role that Russian nationality played within the Soviet Union.

**Krastev:** Totally. Listen, there's a historian, Yuri Slezkine, who wrote this beautiful [article](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2501300) some decades ago describing the Soviet Union as a communal apartment. Where basically different ethnic groups had a room of their own, and the Russians were controlling the hallway, the toilets, and probably the kitchen. But the most important story—and here it gets interesting—is that while the Russians were dominant in the Soviet project, the Soviet project was also organized around the fear of Russian nationalism. As a result, Russia was the only republic that didn’t have its own Communist Party. There never was a Russian Communist Party during the communist period, except for the last two years. And there wasn’t a Russian government either. There was a Ukrainian government, a Georgian government, but no Russian government.

So from this point of view, Russian nationalism allowed others to feel “Russian” in a way—if they spoke the language, for example. It was a much more imperial identity. But when the Soviet Union collapsed, Russian nationalism was a latecomer. It was very weak. Russians started to really envy the Balts, the Georgians, and others who had traditional nationalisms.

Now, going back to these exceptional states: Germany was exceptional in two ways. They committed the ultimate crime—the genocide, the Holocaust. But they were also the ones who were willing to take responsibility for it. And as a result, Germany became the country that symbolized the failure of classical nationalism, militarism, and so on. Peace became part of the German identity. It’s interesting to see how all the wars we have today—whether Russia’s war in Ukraine or the war in the Middle East—are becoming crises for Germany’s postwar identity. Germans felt guilty for what they had done to the Russians, the Ukrainians, and the Soviets, but suddenly, they can no longer feel that way when the Russians are the aggressors. And they also felt guilty for what they did to the Jews. But that guilt also makes it very difficult for them to take any critical position toward the state of Israel, even when others accuse them of not doing so. So in my view, all of these exceptional states are no longer exceptional.

Trump was the last one to say that American exceptionalism is not America’s strength—it’s America’s _vulnerability_. By the way, Obama began this idea himself. He said, _we’re more of a normal state_. But the story that America should have a mission of its own—and all these American presidents, whether on the right or the left, who shared the idea that America doesn’t _have_ an ideology because it _is_ an ideology—is not true anymore.

The major story with Trump is: America is the _victim_ of its exceptionalism. America is the victim of its idealism. America is the victim of the American Dream. The only thing that should be exceptional about America, in his view, is American _power_. And I believe this makes the world fundamentally different. Because it’s not just international institutions—it’s that this idea of exceptionalism used to discipline the politics of the international order.

**Mounk:** Even American power, for Trump, doesn’t need to be exceptional in the traditional sense. He opposed the idea of America as a world policeman. He wants America to be predominant in its sphere of influence, and he wants that sphere of influence to be large, and that dominance to be felt heavily. But he’s perfectly fine with giving Ukraine, effectively, to Russia. Perfectly fine with giving Taiwan, effectively, to China. So even in that sense, he’s thinking of America as a much more classic, non-exceptional superpower—dominant within its regions, but not the exceptional, global power that structures the world. So—with apologies to Francis Fukuyama—are we living through _the_ end of history now, and it just turned out to look rather different from what he expected?

That is, in 1989, the universalist project of communism had failed. The project of fascism had failed. Liberal democracy stood alone as the victorious universalist project. And so it looked like _that_ would be the worldview to shape the future indefinitely. If what we’re seeing now is the end of American exceptionalism, which also means the end of American universalism—and there is no universalist alternative—then what comes next? The Communist Party of China doesn’t believe in world revolution the way the Soviet Union once did. Putin may want to be more influential and recreate a new Russian empire, but he doesn’t want the world under Russian control. He certainly doesn’t want Russian _ideals_ to structure the world.

If you’re right—that the strange thing about this moment in the United States is that neither political side is promising to restore American ideals or American universalism—then is the end of history actually coming in 2025, rather than in 1989? And does it consist not in the triumph of liberal democracy, but in the _passing away_ of universalist ambition?

**Krastev:** Listen, you can call this the end of the _long_ 20th century. You remember, Eric Hobsbawm talked about the “short” 20th century—starting in 1914 and ending in 1989. It was an age of extremes. But what we have now is a world that is more interconnected than ever. We know each other better than ever. And paradoxically, it is our _interconnectedness_ that led to the crisis of the idea of universal humanity. Isn’t it ironic that the philosopher we associate most with universalism, Immanuel Kant, was famous for never leaving his small town of Königsberg? In a way, it’s easier to believe in universal humanity when you don’t actually _see_ it—when it’s just a project of the imagination.

One of the most interesting things about Trump, from this perspective—and this is very different from the American tradition—is that he does not believe people are equal. And he does not believe that states are equal either. When he talks to Ukrainians, he basically says, _You’re a smaller state. Russia is a bigger state. Russia is stronger. Why do you believe you should resist your fate?_ To me, this is very strange. Because the entire foundation of American ideology was that people are equal, states are equal. And suddenly that idea of equality is gone—and people are ready to accept it.

That’s why the drive for _universal recognition_—which was, in my view, a very important insight of Fukuyama’s book—is something people can’t just laugh off. You can’t understand the world if you don’t understand that impulse. But now, we’ve swung to the opposite extreme. And sometimes, coming from a very small country in the middle of nowhere, when I look at the American conflict—especially between the radical left and radical right—it looks to me like a clash between golf courses and university campuses. Both sides have a strange idea of equality, but it's an equality that only applies _within_ their space. That’s where Trump comes in. Because people see the world as very unequal—economically, culturally—and that’s why they’re ready to trust him. We’ve reached a point where only the cynics can be trusted.

And when you ask whether the “end of history” has ended—listen, Fukuyama was very clear: the end of history was never meant to be utopian. He believed people would be _married_ to democracy, but not _in love_ with it. It would be a post-heroic society. Do you remember that on the second to last page he mentions a guy called Donald Trump? Because he's asking this very simple question: Is the recognition you're basically getting as a successful real estate businessperson and so on enough? To what extent can a post-heroic society fulfill this kind of idea of ultimate recognition that history was giving it?

So, funnily enough, I do believe that the second part of Fukuyama's book is even more relevant to what we're doing. And this is not _The End of History_, but _The Last Man_. And in a strange way—which I do believe makes the Trumpian government very interesting—it is this very strong sense of apocalypticism which is present there. Even when we talk about utopians like Musk—technological utopians—even when we talk about people who are very much betting on individual immortality, on the other side there is a very strong sense of catastrophe. From this point of view, by the way, even when you look at Ukraine and how they’re treating Ukraine, this is interesting to look at for Europeans, and particularly for Poles. For Poles, everything that is happening is very much about the lessons of World War II. It’s very much about Munich all over again.

If you listen carefully to Trump—and I do believe he's very genuine when he talks about his fear of World War III—for him, Ukraine is the fear of the lessons of World War I. It's about sleepwalking. And somebody like Peter Thiel, in my view, very well conceptualized it. Because if there is some strong concept—one that I believe is not going to be reflected—Trump is not the person who is going to read a book, he’s not even going to listen to an audiobook, it’s not how he gets it. He’s reacting. For him, he's not simply part of a reality show, but for him, life _is_ a reality show. But this type of mimetic apocalypticism that comes from people like René Girard is very important for them. They believe something that is just the opposite of Fukuyama. Fukuyama's major intuition—by the way, coming from modernization theory, coming from Hegel—was: the more similar we become, the less risk of war and destruction.

**Mounk:** That's very interesting. I want to return to your point about the state for a moment. A different way of casting that question is perhaps going to this point about sclerosis. There are some ways in which the American state obviously was becoming sclerotic. There's a big debate at the moment in the United States about the inability of the American state to build. Why is it impossible to build high-speed rail between San Francisco and Los Angeles, when China has built dozens or hundreds of high-speed rail lines over the course of the last 20 years? Why is it impossible to build housing in areas of opportunity like Los Angeles or New York in a way that then locks people out of opportunity and is a huge reason for why people feel that the state is not delivering for them in all kinds of ways?

There's a deeper sense of sclerosis in terms of the attitude towards institutions. You go back 30 years in America and people trusted Congress, they trusted the Supreme Court, they trusted the local government, they trusted universities, they trusted corporations. Today, trust in all of these institutions is significantly reduced. Interestingly, actually, people trust Silicon Valley companies—which are often the bogeyman of the left—more than many of these other institutions. But trust across the span has gone down. It’d be very hard to imagine even a radical Republican president attacking Harvard and Columbia and those institutions in the same way 20 or 30 years ago, because they had broad trust and support in the population. And one of the reasons why the administration is able to do that now is that there isn’t broad trust and respect in those institutions. Less than 50% of Americans have any positive feelings about them, and those are highly concentrated in a partisan way.

If you look at this broader sclerosis of American life, it forces you to ask a question that I've been struggling to answer for myself over the last few months, one that I feel really torn on, which is: What would or what should happen after Trump? Let's assume that he rules for four years, becomes quite unpopular, doesn’t manage to capture the electoral institutions in such a way that the playing field in 2028 is too uneven for the opposition to have a chance to win, and we get some Democratic president. This is a set of assumptions which may prove to be wrong, but let’s assume that for the moment. How should they think about what to recreate? Should we be trying to recreate any part of the _status quo ante_? All parts of the _status quo ante_?

It feels to me like the answer must lie somewhere in between those extremes. But what elements of the old system can we save and recreate? And what elements of it were so ripe for plucking that any attempt to put them back in place is bound to fail?

**Krastev:** I’d be lying to you if I said I even have the illusion that I have an answer. But I can just go on thinking along the lines that you suggested. First, if this is a revolution, revolution changes the identity of all players. No political party or actor is going to get out of the revolution the way they started it. You can have Lenin after Kerensky; you cannot have Kerensky after Lenin. It is a totally different story. The Democratic Party is going to be as dramatically transformed by the Trumpian revolution—for good or for bad—as the Republican Party is.

Then comes the story of what happens to the state. And this is a really interesting story, because in my view, the biggest failure of the Democratic Party is their deep belief that they can recreate the Rooseveltian type of big state that is trusted. From this point of view, I’m sure that in 10 years, people are going to look at the COVID experience as a much more important part of the political change the world is going through than we are talking about now.

Listen, it’s not about this or that COVID policy. But during the COVID period, three important things about the state and our lives became very clear. The first is that everything that was previously perceived as impossible became possible. In one day, both the dreams of the right and the left were fulfilled. You remember, if you're basically a radical green person, you’re dreaming of a day when all planes are going to be grounded and stop polluting the planet—but you never believe it can happen. And then COVID came, and they were all grounded. They were all grounded overnight. If you’re a right-wing radical, you’re dreaming about a country in which nobody crosses the borders—there are no immigrants. And again, you don’t believe it’s ever going to happen. And then, it happened overnight. The borders were closed. I’m saying this because the first thing COVID did was make possible and thinkable things that, until yesterday, were perceived as impossible—even if they were desirable.

The second thing that happened was the crisis of the idea of science. In my view, one of the things we’re seeing is not simply an attack on universities, but the fact that science was as important for the modern state as God was for the monarchical states of the past. The legitimacy of the state was coming from science. But the problem with science—particularly at the level we’re at now—is that science functions because scientists disagree with each other. It was very difficult for people because COVID came, and then doctors started to disagree with each other. And suddenly, science—even though it was successful, even though we had vaccines, even though the crisis was, in a certain way, contained—delegitimized the state by the very way it works: through disagreement and constantly-changing hypotheses.

**Mounk:** Was the problem that scientists disagreed, or was the problem that science was used as a slogan to shut down disagreement? Which is to say, among actual scientists, there was disagreement throughout COVID—as there should be, as discoveries emerged and hypotheses evolved. And I think you’re right that there’s a question about whether science caused the pandemic. There’s a question about whether, again, gain-of-function research actually was the original cause of all of this, which would impact our assessment. In terms of scientists springing into action, making these incredible vaccines, helping us get out of the crisis—I think you’re right that, at some level, science should be knighted for what it did.

But the problem to me seems to be that “Science” with a capital-S became this kind of slogan—an argument from authority. You can’t disagree with my proposition about how society should be run during the pandemic, or how we should think about the virus's origins, or whether you need to stay six feet apart from me—because “Science” has given the answer. Often, some scientists themselves—but especially public health authorities, mainstream journalists, and so on—invoked this capital-S “Science” as the ultimate proof of what was correct, in a way that didn’t require argument and actually went against what genuine scientific spirit would demand.

**Krastev:** I totally agree with you. But don’t forget—in the way the modern state tries to use science, particularly in moments of crisis, it’s like how the old monarchs used the idea of God and religion. Because you need something to legitimize your authority. You need science to tell me why I should trust _you_ and not myself. Of course, in my own country—Bulgaria—the most famous slogan during COVID was, _everybody decides for himself_. That was a real, strong individual response.

But what happened is also that the state, in order to get the loyalty of the people, did something incredible. It almost promised people immortality. You remember—every single death, even of a very old person, was perceived as almost a crime. I believe that this prospect—_we can take care of you, we can save you from everything, we can save you from death but only if you trust u_s—worked for a while. It worked for six months. After that, it produced a major backlash, which in my view was very important for the rise of the far right. Not only in America, not only for Trump—you see it everywhere in Europe.

Here, I think it's very important to understand what I see as the failure of the Biden presidency, because Biden was not a trivial president. He came in as a transformative president, and he believed that he could recreate or resurrect the Rooseveltian-era state. And that was a state that could care for people, that could build things, that was about re-industrialization. For him, the COVID experience was what convinced him that this could be done. But I believe Wolfgang Streeck, one of the important German sociologists on the left, made a point that I take very seriously. The classical trusted state of the 1930s in America under Roosevelt—or of the 1950s and 60s in Europe—was based on the idea that it responded to and took care of human _needs_. But today, it must take care of human _desires_. And the most important thing is that while the market is taking care of your desires, the state cannot. Because I want the state to treat me as a very specific personality—but the state, in order to be fair, must treat me like everybody else. We’re no longer ready to live with that.

The market has taught us that we have very specific needs, personalities, and desires. And we now see it as repression when the state treats us all as equal. By the way, I mean “equal” in not a very inventive way. This lies at the heart of the crisis of trust in the state. Plus, the fact that the modern person is constantly being asked to have opinions about things for which they have no personal experience.

The real equality of every democratic regime is that our _experiences_ are equal. Not our values, incomes, or talents—but my experience and your experience in democratic politics are equal. And nobody can articulate my experience better than me. But suddenly, you’re being asked to have opinions about things you’ve never experienced and _cannot_ experience. And this created a kind of trust–mistrust game. As a result, democracy became the management of mistrust.

**Mounk:** We haven’t talked that much, it occurs to me, about the international dimension. How permanently do you think the standing of the United States in the world is going to be altered by what Trump is doing? To what extent is this going to put in place a very different vision of what America is and signifies? I’m interested in that question in the context of East Asia, Latin America, and Africa—but of course, particularly of Europe. Because certainly in Western Europe, and in big parts of Central and Eastern Europe, the continent has relied on the United States as its key strategic partner since 1945—or in some places, since 1989.

It seems that the continent, in many ways, has believed it doesn’t need to do certain things. Obvious things like investing in the military sufficiently to defend itself—but also, perhaps, more tangible things like being at the forefront of technological evolution and industry. Because it would always be protected by a nation that is doing those things. Does this mean the end of 75 years of European–American trust? Could it still be a kind of aberration? If the Democrats win again in 2028, are European statesmen going to go back to pretending everything is fine like they did when Biden was elected in 2020? If not, what does the effective end of the transatlantic alliance signify—both for the United States and for Europe?

**Krastev:** I believe that the effect on Europe of Trump's presidency is stronger than on any other part of the world, regardless of the fact that I'm sure Europe is not at the center of his interest. The funny story about Europe is that we managed to create a kind of society which was very much preconditioned on American security guarantees, on cheap Russian gas, on open Chinese markets. And all this has disappeared in a period of almost less than a decade. I don't believe that the relations can be the same, regardless of what is going to happen. Which does not mean that the United States and Europe are not going to be allies or that they cannot work together. They're going to work together one way or another. But everything is changing. Although, Europe is going about it in a funny way because we start to talk about sovereignty and so on as if this can be born overnight. The technological dependency on the United States is not going to disappear, regardless of what Trump is doing.

But also, suddenly, Europe cannot tell itself the story that it used to. Europe before was looking like the laboratory for the world to come. Probably this was a laboratory built on American money, but _we_ were the laboratory of the world to come, not the Americans. We are going with the postmodern state. We have basically much more social spending. So, in a certain way, the idea was that even America is going to become much more European.

There was a moment in which this was very much discussed. Suddenly we Europeans felt very lonely. When Trump was elected, the European Council on Foreign Relations did a survey in 21 countries—11 European countries and 10 of the biggest countries in the world: India, Brazil, Turkey, China, Russia, Saudi Arabia. There were three simple questions among others: _Do you believe that Trump is good for America? Do you believe that Trump is good for your country? Do you believe that Trump is good for peace?_ Almost everywhere outside of Europe, people were saying, _yes, Trump is good for America. Trump is good for my country. Trump is good for peace._ Of course, it was only in Europe—and particularly Western Europe and also South Korea—that people were ready to say no.

I'm saying this because suddenly Trump came and he's surprising and he's striking and nobody likes the disruption that he caused. But he's a type of leader that the other part of the world understands easily. And there is something very strange about Trump, which I do believe people are going to get puzzled by as time goes on. Everybody looks at him as a classical American nationalist. But through this lens, there are certain things that you cannot understand—for example, his view on land. For the nationalist, basically, land is sacred. Land is given by God to nations. When he was developing his idea of basically Gaza becoming a major resort, you see that Trump sees land through the eyes of real estate. Strangely enough, if you're going to ask Trump how to improve the world, probably what he's going to tell you is it's about gentrification. Rich people are going to go into bad neighborhoods, and poor people are going to go somewhere else. And some of the poor people are going to become richer.

And, for example, when he talks to the Ukrainians, this is a great lesson in misunderstanding, because Ukrainians said, _we need the guarantee that you're ready to defend us_. They imagined the world like the Cold War, in which you're defending us because we are a democracy, we are allies, and we are not going to allow Russia to do this and that. And Trump said, _yes, we could be ready to defend you, but do you know what? Your best defense is if you're going to give us your mineral resources and your pipelines and your infrastructure, because the only way to stop the Russians from destroying infrastructure is if they know that it's American infrastructure_. _And the only way to convince Americans to defend your infrastructure is if they believe that they are defending an American company_. I will say something that is not easy to say. When I was watching what happened in the Oval Office between Trump and Zelensky, I had the feeling that it was also a clash between two different television programs. On one level, it's a reality show, and on the other, it's a much more kind of classical heroic narrative. One is speaking the language of the nation, and the other is basically speaking this making-a-deal story.

In addition, even when we talk about defense capabilities, Europeans talk about money. Germany is going to spend so much money, etc. But listen, when you talk even to the most unimpressive captain in the army, they're going to tell you, _budgets don't fight wars. People fight wars_. This is the major issue for European society. The biggest success of Europe was that it made war unthinkable for the majority of Europeans. Now the biggest vulnerability for Europe is that war looks unthinkable for the majority of Europeans.

**Mounk:** I have two thoughts about this. The first is that one strange aspect of Europe is that Italy always feels like the country of the past, and turns out to have the politics of the future. You go back to the medieval city-states and they feel in some ways like remnants of ancient Rome or ancient Athens, but they prefigure in certain ways the rise of modern democracy. You go to Mussolini, he obviously prefigures the rise of fascism. I mean, you get to Berlusconi in the 1990s. Again, he’s sort of laughed at and looked at with pity, and Italy is sort of treated as a strange aberration. But he in many ways prefigures the rise of right-wing populists who are ideological—but even more so, right-wing populists who are in certain ways _non_\-ideological, like Donald Trump.

Now, conversely, you might say that Europe as a whole has sold itself as the continent of the future. And there was a real moment in the 2000s that I think you were alluding to, when there were—I don't know how best-selling the books were—but books that got a lot of attention in intellectual circles and political circles that were arguing that really Europe and the European Union is the model of the future. The African Union in some ways was modeled on emulating some of that. There’s always been a movement of highly educated Americans who thought that Europeans are really so much more civilized than us here and we should emulate them. Europe did feel, quite recently to some people, like the continent of the future.

But it's in some ways turned out now to be a model that may not be defensible—a model that was reliant on the external support of a country like the United States. The most obvious way is in the military sphere, where I certainly think that Germany—where I grew up—always had this sort of disdain for those American cowboys who were so obsessed with the military budgets and the guns. This was based on the complete willful ignorance of the fact that Germany could afford not to spend money on its military and not afford to have a large army because we could always rely on the United States coming in to defend us.

Think of the show _Borgen_, about a kind of center-left, somewhat technocratic, idealistic prime minister who breaks with a governing coalition because she's not going to compromise on immigration. It was meant to make her look like the politician of the future, and the populists in the show were these kind of troglodyte old idiots. You go back and look at _Borgen_ now and it feels very old-fashioned. It feels like a lost world, even though I think some of the later episodes are less than 10 years old. So there is something to that in Europe. The question is, _what is European self-invention going to look like?_ There are the obvious answers, which is that the continent needs to spend more money on its military because it can't rely on the United States anymore, and it needs to invest in infrastructure because it needs to have more economic growth. And the Germans need to go back to having trains that actually run on time—because at the moment their trains are less punctual than Italian ones, which is both an economic and an identity crisis.

All of that seems fine, and I don't disagree with any of it. But it doesn't add up to a project, and it doesn't add up to a vision. And the larger question to me is whether Europe can recognize that it has become a museum continent—that it lived in a fantasy of gradual and gracious decline, in which it could absent itself from history without having to pay a high price for that. In which, even if you are not one of the forces that shape history, you can have a good welfare state and nice bicycle lanes and a decent life for your citizens.

But if you don't shape history, history shapes you. If you're not at the forefront of technological development, you're not going to be able to defend yourself no matter how much money you spend on the military. And if your fate is determined by outside powers and your economy is not at the cutting edge, the decline in your welfare states might turn out to be much more precipitous and much more economically painful than you recognize. But I don't get the impression from afar—I'm in the United States at the moment—that that lesson has arrived for the European public, or even less so, that anybody has a vision for what it would take to change the fate of the continent.

**Krastev:** Listen, I'm not famous for optimism, but one of the most interesting books in Europe was written in 1978 or ’79. Raymond Aron wrote a book called _In Defense of Decadent Europe_. And of course, back then, it was very much about French politics. The French left was coming to power. This is basically what happened with Mitterrand and others. But don't forget, decadence does not necessarily mean decline. The paradoxically interesting story is that Europe is going to look for a new identity for sure. For Europe, the identity based on the Cold War is not there anymore, the Cold War West is over. You're also totally right on the level of security, because we can move money here and there—but, if I'm going to be particularly critical about Europe, even when you listen to the way we talk about Ukraine you have the feeling from time to time that, in the same way we were outsourcing our security to the United States before, now we want to outsource our security to the big Ukrainian army that is going to stay there and defend us against the Russians.

But the most interesting part of the story between Trump and Europe—even between European nationalists and Trumpists—is that Trump's type of nationalism is divorced from history. It is history-free. Listen, what do nationalists normally talk about when they meet? They talk about history and how history was unfair to their countries. Can you imagine Donald Trump talking about history with anybody? So basically the only history he can talk about is his own history—the only kind of history of the American Republic is the first Trump presidency. So in a strange way, his American individualism operates at the level of national ideology. _I'm not interested in what was before me. And to be honest, I'm not interested in what's going to be after me._

For Europe, that means: how are you going to reconcile the fact that, in a moment of crisis, all European nations go back to their national histories? And at the same time, in order to stay together, they should have a common identity. Because Europe before was a project, and in a strange way, Europeans can have common dreams, but their nightmares are totally national. You could see it dramatically both with the war in the Middle East and with the war in Ukraine. I find this quite important because history is going to play an important role in the way Europe is going to remake itself.

In the 1990s and the early 2000s, Europe saw itself as a missionary, exactly because we were the future. We were there to tell others how to live. Europe specialized in lecturing others, even more than the Americans. Now Europe feels like a monastery. The only problem of the monastery is: how are you going to defend yourself? Secondly, how are you going to feed yourself? Suddenly, European universalism is going to become universal exceptionalism. Europe will face what happened to Russia after the end of the Soviet Union, and even in a certain way, what is happening to America after Trump.

But this is a project that can collapse very easily. Europe also has, in a strange way, the wisdom of old people. When they go on the streets, they're carefully looking at the pavement. And I thought this was important. Many people today are saying, _Europe is like it was in the 1920s and 1930s_. No, we're not back in the 1920s and '30s. In the 1920s and '30s, Europe was a very young continent and it was populated by ex-soldiers. And now Europe is a much older continent, and it is populated by people who don't believe that they're ever going to be soldiers. So from this point of view, it's about creating your own space. I don't expect this rapid transformation that can happen in other places. I don't see another modernization of Europe.

**Mounk:** I think you're absolutely right. I think our instincts at least are very similar about what Europe’s event horizon is. In the 1920s, of course, Europe was literally a young continent in the sense that the average age was vastly younger than it is today. It was a continent that still had a completely different self-confidence, as standing at the center of the world. In some ways, of course, it no longer did. The United States by the 1920s was as powerful or more powerful than Europe, but that is not how most Europeans saw it. And colonies, of course, were still very much a going concern at that time. There was a much more fervent nationalism, and the recent experience of war gave some people a sense of victory and confidence, and gave others humiliation and a desire for revenge.

All of that is fundamentally different from today. I think the question to me is whether the assumption that there can be a decent life in decline turns out to be right or not. And I'm not sure about that. I'm not sure about that in terms of the demographics of Europe, where the population is rapidly shrinking. I'm not sure about that in terms of international relations, because I don't think we've yet fully seen the impact of basically having your fate determined by the whims of much less reliable partners in Washington, D.C.—or worse, by Vladimir Putin and Russia or Xi Jinping and China.

It's not clear to me that it will turn out to be true economically. Germany is a good example of a country that had a very stable economy and is now in serious danger. If the German car manufacturers start to go bankrupt, a lot of the basic aspects of the political economy of the continent are going to change. So I hope that this sort of vision of an old continent that carefully looks at the ground so it doesn't stumble, and whose horizons are perhaps a little bit limiting—but that gets home safe to a heated apartment and has a nice dinner waiting for it—proves to be right. I have less confidence in that than most observers seem to at this moment.

**Krastev:** To be honest, I'm much more on your side. But it's very important to also understand what we're going to value. We don't know how the world is going to look. From this point of view, what is a competitive advantage or disadvantage can dramatically change. I believe that Europe is never going to be the most dynamic power in the world—exactly because of its democracy, but also its culture. But what is interesting is that when you're looking at some European societies, there is so much invisible change. Did you know that the number of foreigners as a percent of the population who are now living in Austria is higher than in Canada?

**Mounk:** Wow, I did not know that.

**Krastev:** This is the story of Europe. In Europe, unlike in America, change is not in your face. America is a place where you basically notice only what is moving. Only what is changing is worth talking about. Europeans change a lot, but Europeans are starting to pretend that the change is much more limited. I'm giving one example on the level of population, but there are many other things that have changed. I believe that different cultures have a different idea of adaptation. As a result, the biggest problem for Europe is trying to pretend to be what it is not going to be. Europe is never going to succeed in the heavy economic dynamism of the United States—even if all of the Draghi report is implemented. And Europe is not going to have the kind of readiness to die in a war that Putin’s Russia has—even if you increase spending here or there.

But I do believe Europe was built on this kind of idea of moderation. We went too far away from this, unfortunately. I'm remember the old film _Being There_, where the major protagonist was a gardener living in one of the family estates, taking care of his garden and spending all his leisure time watching television with a remote control in his hand—changing the channels anytime he did not like anything in life. So when he had to leave his position, he was attacked on the street. And what he did, facing danger, was try to change the channel. So in a certain way, over the last years—particularly in the post-1989 decades—Europe has changed a lot, but we looked like a person armed with a remote control, who believed that anytime we don't like what we see, we can change the channel. Obviously now we're basically very much doomed to watch either the Trump channel or the Putin channel. And of course, this is changing Europeans.

This leads to a certain reflective kind of resilience. Suddenly you know that you can lose certain things. You know what you want to keep. And probably this is the best chance for Europe. Is it going to work? I don't know. You need political leadership. Also, you need luck. And that’s not easy, especially when you’re depending on so many kinds of uncertainties—starting with the fact that you have so many different member states in the Union.

Pope Francis on November 24, 2024 in the Vatican City. (Photo by Vatican Media via Vatican Pool/Getty Images.)

The last twelve years have been turbulent. We have witnessed the rapid rise of populist politics, the advent of new, earth-shattering technologies, and the fracturing of a tenuous international peace. Throughout all of the chaos, the Catholic Church has been steered by the firmly gentle hand of Pope Francis. Even as the instability of the twenty-first century bled into religion, Pope Francis attempted to guide the church in the direction of compassion and humility. That he did not always succeed at this task is not entirely surprising and no doubt he could have gone much further. Yet the simple, unadorned goodness of the late Pope is something that will be missed in this age of bombastic cruelty.

Nowhere was the compassion of Pope Francis better displayed than his interaction with children. In [2018](https://nypost.com/2025/04/21/world-news/tear-jerking-moment-pope-francis-consoles-boy-who-asked-if-dead-atheist-dad-was-in-heaven-resurfaces/), the elderly Pope was approached by a young Italian boy who feared his recently deceased atheist father was in Hell. Many priests would have responded with a long discourse on purgatory or a kind but obfuscating answer. That was not the way of Pope Francis. He took the small child in his arms and whispered words of genuine consolation—affirming that the Church and the Kingdom of Heaven are accepting and forgiving places. Perhaps more importantly, he proclaimed to both this boy and the world that love is the true hallmark of a good life rather than conventional religious belief or legalistic obedience.

Born Jorge Bergoglio in Argentina just before the outbreak of World War II, Francis’ life coincided with a rising crisis of faith brought about by the tragedy of a war-torn world and the apotheosis of materialistic philosophy. As a young man, Bergoglio stepped into the confessional of a church on his way to a celebration. This quiet encounter in the confession box forever altered his life. Upon leaving the church, Bergoglio knew he wished to dedicate his life to his Catholic faith.

After becoming a member of the Jesuit order, Bergoglio rose quickly through the Church hierarchy. In time he would become the head of his order in Argentina and eventually the Archbishop of Buenos Aires. He was finally appointed to the cardinalate in 2001. Throughout his time in Argentina, Bergoglio became a lightning rod for controversy in his many attempts to maintain peace with Argentina’s frequently despotic government. At the same time, Bergoglio earned a reputation for humility and honesty almost unparalleled among bishops in the modern Catholic Church. He forsook the usual trappings of his office and preferred to live in a plain apartment and use public transportation. This reputation for simple Christian wholesomeness helped catapult him to the papacy in 2013.

At the time Francis ascended to the throne of St. Peter, crisis and scandal weighed heavily on the Church. Rocked by seemingly endless sexual assault allegations and with a rapidly declining church membership, the College of Cardinals set the new pope a big task. His predecessor—Pope Benedict XVI—had sought to rejuvenate the Church by helping it return to the great universal truths that had guided it in previous ages. An academic by training, Benedict saw that the rise of moral relativism and the challenge of modern “secular humanist” science posed significant threats to the Church’s teaching. By focusing with great precision and firmness on the intellectual precepts that undergird Christian faith, Benedict believed Christianity could be restored to its former glory. In the end, however, his earnest academic approach—held sacred still by so many high-minded conservative Christians—proved inadequate to the challenges of modernity.

Upon his election, Pope Francis immediately began to chart a different course. Somehow, he intuited that the present crisis of faith is not an intellectual one—not a product of some defective reasoning or wrongly held precept—but a sickness of the heart. The malaise of modernity stems from a frustrated anger at a universe that seems cruel, uncaring, and incapable of fully acknowledging each individual’s unique importance in creation. In short, we humans—who so long to be eternal—have started to feel that in the grand scheme of things we do not matter that much. After all, in the face of artificial intelligence, the global economy, and the vastness of outer space, who amongst us can claim to be special or significant?

Pope Francis worked throughout his papacy to answer this question and refute the painful potentiality of human uselessness. He did so not with great glittering theories but through simple Christian goodness. He lobbied for every single action taken by the Church to be centered on the dignity of all individual souls. For him, this attitude formed the very heart of Chrisitan faith. As he expressed it in his very last [homily](https://www.rappler.com/world/europe/full-text-pope-francis-last-homily-easter-sunday-2025/), delivered the day before his death on Easter Monday, when we look for Christ we find Him everywhere: in the eyes of our fellow man, in the majesty of nature, and in our very selves. To lose faith—as is all too common in an age of doubt—is simply part of the process, an avenue to the joy sparked by rediscovery. In short, for believers and nonbelievers alike, Pope Francis helped to revive the mystery and beauty of a more romantic age.

What Francis took to be the practical implications of this teaching have continued to spark protest. Early on in his papacy, he sought to expunge the Church of any teaching or behavior he deemed exclusionary or elitist. Some of these changes—such as reforming the Vatican Bank—have proved almost universally popular outside the stuffy Roman Curia. Other actions, such as his attempts to make the Church more open to women and sexual minorities, caused many conservatives to label him a heretic unconcerned with longstanding Church teaching. Perhaps as an attempt to avoid alienating right-wing Catholics further, or simply out of frustration with the anti-reform Church bureaucracy, Francis never fully challenged the controversial conventions of Catholic social teaching. Instead, he preferred to dance around the issue and in the end left most unsatisfied with his position.

Also concerning to many, Francis sought to quash the traditional Latin Mass and other liturgies commonly practiced among more conservative congregations. This move revealed a frightening inability to fully comprehend the necessity of pluralism to modern religion. No Church or society in the twenty-first century is likely to be able to foist a singular theology upon a world of highly educated citizens. Instead, toleration of both the liberal and the conservative must be the hallmark of any flourishing church.

Despite these weaknesses, Francis’ approach to faith inspired a generation of Christians—Protestant and Catholic alike—to renew their fading faiths in the light of his unwavering goodness. Whether one is a believer or not, it is impossible not to be moved by the generosity of spirit he constantly showed to the poor and downtrodden. His kindly interactions with migrants, the homeless, the poor, and other outsiders gave the world a shining example of true generosity. In so doing, Pope Francis brought faith to a cynical and disbelieving world. In an age of strongmen he was something far greater and far rarer—a good man.

Last Thursday, at a press conference announcing the CDC’s new autism prevalence rates—1 in 31 kids affected, up from 1 in 36 two years ago—HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. described “kids who will never pay taxes, they’ll never hold a job, they’ll never play baseball, they’ll never write a poem. They’ll never go out on a date. Many of them will never use a toilet unassisted.”

Pretty benign account of profound autism, I thought. If it had been me at the podium the reporters would have gotten an earful about traumatic brain injury and blindness from self-injury; seizures, insomnia, and constipation; emergency surgery from pica (the compulsion to eat inedible objects); drownings following elopement; parents who live in a near-constant state of crisis. Baseball? Poetry? Not even on the wish list.

[Subscribe now](https://www.persuasion.community/subscribe?)

So when I saw this exact excerpt from Kennedy’s press conference circulating on social media, I initially assumed it was out of empathy, to support profoundly autistic people and their families. But no. Parents of more mildly affected kids took to X to set Kennedy straight: their autistic children were Eagle Scouts, concert pianists, published authors, college students with perfect GPAs. Then came the posts from self-proclaimed allies, offended on behalf of these accomplished autistic children. Elizabeth Warren [dismissed](https://x.com/SenWarren/status/1912895256040726625) Kennedy’s descriptors as “lies” because “autistic people contribute every day to our nation’s greatness.” She called his version of autism “disgusting”—an invective that reverberated across the platform, echoed on big accounts—including those of _Atlantic_ contributor [Jemele Hill](https://x.com/jemelehill/status/1912685507655446863) and Columbia School of Journalism faculty member [Marlow Stern](https://x.com/MarlowNYC/status/1912611620028559865).

I have been advocating for my son Jonah, 26, and his profoundly autistic peers for two decades, and I’ve also been on the receiving end of countless insults and attacks. Every time I’ve described Jonah’s challenges—a history of aggression that necessitated an almost year-long hospitalization when he was only nine years old; minimal speech and no abstract concepts; a complete lack of safety awareness that means he can never be left alone—I’ve been attacked for my “dehumanizing” and “ableist” language.

Neurodiversity proponents, who consider severe autism an identity rather than a devastating neurological impairment, have accused me of hating my son and proclaimed that I should lose custody of all my kids. But nothing I’ve ever encountered hit harder than that one word, _disgust_. Because that was targeted not at me, but at Jonah. People like Warren, Hill, and Stern—whose experience with autism, if any, apparently does not include the most severely affected end of the spectrum—explicitly cited Kennedy’s list of nevers and found it “disgusting.” Not sad, not extraordinarily challenging, not deserving of support, but disgusting. If there’s a more dehumanizing and ableist word, I can’t think of it.

Obviously, Kennedy’s description doesn’t apply to all autistic people. Earlier in the press conference, he referred to the “25% of the kids who are diagnosed with autism \[who\] are non-verbal” and frequently exhibit dangerous behaviors, such as “head-banging.” This reflects a 2023 CDC [prevalence study](https://autismsciencefoundation.org/press_releases/cdc-profound-autism-statistics/#:~:text=April%2019%2C%202023%20%E2%80%94%20The%20Centers,spectrum%20disorder%20have%20profound%20autism.) that reported that 27% of autistic children meet the criteria for profound autism, meaning they are minimally verbal or non-verbal and/or severely intellectually disabled (with an IQ below 50). It was obvious to me that this was the segment of the autism spectrum Kennedy was talking about—something he later clarified on Fox News. Even if it wasn’t obvious to everyone, the reflex to reject this narrative because it doesn’t comport with your own experience or understanding struck me as incontrovertibly myopic and illogical.

[Subscribe now](https://www.persuasion.community/subscribe?)

Also not generalizable to all cases is Kennedy’s claim that “autism destroys families”— something many critics were quick to challenge. Actress Holly Robinson Peete [retorted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE) in a recorded response that “autism didn’t break my family. It made us braver, it made us closer, it made us more compassionate.”

Autism didn’t break my family, either, because we had the time and skill-set necessary to navigate the fragmented educational, and now adult, disability service systems as well as—and this is what really matters—the resources to fill in the gaps. My husband and I both hold jobs we love; we have coverage for date nights, workouts, and other forms of self-care; our four other kids were never told that they couldn’t do something or go somewhere because of their brother. For Peete not to acknowledge this incredible privilege, or the hundreds of thousands of aging parents facing a lifetime of round-the-clock and intensive care provision because they lack it, is unconscionable.

* * *

* * *

Importantly, this is not a defense of Kennedy or his entire agenda. Most of his autism rhetoric is alarming: his obsession with vaccines, despite dozens of studies that proved they do not cause autism; his choice of an [unqualified, noted vaccine skeptic](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/27/health/rfk-jr-autism-vaccines.html) to spearhead new research into autism; his [fantastical promise](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cj0z9nmzvdlo) to identify the cause of autism by September; his administration’s threats to Medicaid and NIH. We can and should fight for necessary research, as well as robust and evidence-based supports that reflect the diverse needs and preferences of a very heterogeneous community.

But we can do that without minimizing, or, as happened last week, flat-out denying the realities of profound autism. And it neither dilutes nor defangs our advocacy to thank Secretary Kennedy for shining a light on the segment of the autism spectrum that has been increasingly marginalized by a focus on the most capable, and to agree that this very vulnerable and impaired population must be foregrounded in our national conversations about autism research, policy, and practice.

* * *

America is talking about Abundance, and for good reason. Abundance is more than just a recent [book](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Abundance/Derek-Thompson/9781668023488) by Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson. It’s the most successful new intellectual movement in center and center-left circles for at least a decade. Anyone paying attention to the Washington scene has noticed a surge of writers suddenly invoking the word “Abundance,” and think tanks becoming _de facto_ Abundance affiliates.

I share much of the enthusiasm. I see the potential of Abundance to help reform what’s broken in America and address our national discontent. The basic idea is uncontroversial. America has institutions charged with important missions to accomplish things we need done. Countless people get paid well to advance those missions, and yet they never seem to happen. America should actually produce the things it says it wants.

* * *

* * *

I’m concerned, however, about how Abundance has been presented to America—as a partisan movement to fix a broken Democratic Party. It could be more, part of a broader American agenda to fix what’s broken in America. Put simply, I fear it falling into _the Mugwump trap_.

#### **What Is Abundance?**

National institutions with missions critical to people’s lives should fulfil their obligations with competence and excellence. Right now, many of them don’t.

As Klein and Thompson’s book accurately decries, we allocate billions to build [high-speed rail](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/us-opens-probe-into-whether-rescind-4-billion-california-high-speed-rail-grants-2025-02-20/), and years later there’s still no high-speed rail. We allocate billions to build [broadband networks](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/09/04/biden-broadband-program-swing-state-frustrations-00175845) and [charging stations](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/12/05/congress-ev-chargers-billions-00129996), and years later we’ve built neither broadband networks nor charging stations. However, focusing just on government plans for infrastructure vastly understates the problem. This illness permeates every institution in America. It’s expensive schools that fail to reach students. It’s a corporate sector increasingly organized to provide frustrating and shoddy services on purpose. It’s a Congress that refuses to do its job to legislate. It’s incentives that allow finance to eat the real economy. It’s an America that costs a lot, has a lot of processes, and is presided over by people with impressive resumes and paychecks, but provides a barely acceptable experience to the ordinary American.

People tend to make this case in the neutral language of economics. We say America’s institutions are wasteful and inefficient, we lack state capacity, or we’ve erected impediments to investment. How about, it’s infuriating? Things ought to actually work. We need things done. People who live in nice houses and are paid well to accomplish tasks don’t accomplish them—and don’t seem to even care that they don’t. It’s a major source of the anger coursing through America.

The problem is in pitching this agenda as a partisan reform plan for the Democrats. I understand why Klein and Thompson believe Abundance is a good idea for Democrats. The Democratic Party’s worldview centers around using government and institutional heights to push economic and moral progress. The failure of the Blue model of governance to accomplish its agenda is a major drag on the party. Adopting Abundance thinking is a way for Democrats to earn back some of the squandered trust. However, it’s a blunder for the Abundance movement to turn itself into just another partisan reform plan.

* * *

* * *

To begin with, I’m hardly confident the Democratic Party is prepared to embrace an Abundance agenda given its present coalition. The unstated problem is that it isn’t an accident that the party doesn’t accomplish goals, so tweaking a few regulations can’t fix it. Influential factions inside the party are purposefully pursuing goals they consider higher moral imperatives than building things, fulfilling missions, or making things work. Many progressive groups perceive Abundance as hostile to their priorities for good reason—because it is. This is why there’s already been so much pushback in Democratic circles against Abundance. Reorienting the party around these ideas means disempowering powerful people, and they’re going to fight.

Even if you did somehow manage to reform the Democrats around these ideas, however, what then?

We live in an era of national rebellion built around the idea that America’s technocratic and professional elite ignored the interests of the majority, looked out for its own interests, and failed to govern wisely or well, creating a national breach in trust. Selling Abundance as a technocratic agenda to put the same people back in power on the promise that this time they’ll do better can’t address this discontent or calm the national storm. Maybe you can improve governance in a few Blue pockets, but that’s all. If you want to build a winning national coalition that can implement your ideas, sustain them over time, and create a new governing philosophy for America, a version of Abundance sold as a technocratic Democratic Party reform plan is a catastrophe.

Abundance, in other words, is in danger of falling into the Mugwump trap.

#### **The Mugwump Trap**

America has had a lot of good-government political reform movements over its history—Barnburners, Liberal Republicans, Half-Breeds, and all the modern movements you know—and they all ended up like the Mugwumps. They did a bit of good, couldn’t push back the political ocean, and eventually the system ground them down restoring the status quo.

The Mugwumps were a late nineteenth-century reform movement looking to address Gilded Age corruption. This was a dangerous time in America in which the middle class, mostly family farmers left behind by industrialization, was battered while new millionaires amassed fortunes, railroads dominated markets, new immigrants crowded into cities to find sweatshop jobs, and politics was a dirty pit of political machines and graft. Republicans, the more liberal party then, nominated the powerful but scandal-plagued James G. Blaine for president. A bloc of party reformers committed to clean government took a moral stand and walked out, helping to elect the rival Democrat, Grover Cleveland, who had a reformist reputation. Cleveland was elected, and was mildly better on corruption than most presidents of his era. Otherwise, however, the system remained intact while the Mugwumps got drummed out of politics as traitors without a party, their political careers destroyed.

Some version of this always happens when good-government reformers try to fix a broken party. You insert fresh ideas into a dysfunctional machine, and the rusty gears mangle them. As Tammany Hall boss George Washington Plunkitt [said](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Honest+Graft%3A+The+World+of+George+Washington+Plunkitt+\(Plunkitt+of+Tammany+Hall\)%2C+2nd+Edition%2C+Revised-p-9781881089582): “There have been reform committees of fifty, of sixty, of seventy, of one hundred and all sorts of numbers that started out to do up the regular political organizations. They were mornin’ glories—looked lovely in the mornin’ and withered up in a short time, while the regular machines went on flourishin’ forever, like fine old oaks.” This is what I predict will inevitably happen to Abundance if it remains a purely Democratic Party reform.

But there’s a better alternative. Instead of reforming a party, operate across the system to reform politics and America. Tie your ideas to a larger agenda that addresses the source of the national discontent and create a paradigm-shifting movement to reorient the political order. Follow the path of the movement that, just a few years after the Mugwumps failed, accomplished everything they sought to do and more—the historical Progressive Movement.

#### **American Abundance**

The Progressives were without question the most successful reform movement in America’s history. Instead of trying to reform a party, they offered an ideology and agenda attacking the source of the popular anger of their era—the one-two punch of the economic shock of industrialization and Gilded Age stagnation, corruption, and decline. Their agenda attacked political corruption, but tied this to countless other reforms like ending child labor, imposing maximum work hours, breaking up abusive monopolies with antitrust legislation, creating public schools, ending sweatshops, and securing women’s suffrage. They framed these reforms as interconnected solutions rooted in a shared ideology aimed directly at the forces fueling public discontent—economic disruption, political dysfunction, abusive work practices, middle-class deterioration, corruption, stagnation, and a sense of national decline.

Instead of operating as a party adjunct, the Progressives organized as a force outside the system exerting political influence. In practice, they mainly worked at first through Republicans, becoming a powerful bloc inside the party, but gained influence with the Democrats, and in third-party movements too, eventually gaining control of both national parties and the system. The 1912 election was essentially a national referendum over which candidate was the most Progressive. In the end, they enacted almost their entire agenda and solidified it.

That should be the model for Abundance. Instead of a Democratic Party movement, it should be an American movement working to reform politics and America. It should be rolled into a larger and bolder agenda speaking directly to the causes of the rebellion tearing America apart. Americans from the political left to right are angry at the system and the people running it. They’re angry about ineffective government, as well as ineffective private institutions, lack of transparency, poor leadership, corruption, and unaccountable control. All these problems stem from interrelated causes with the same root—a painful collapse in national trust. Abundance can help address that lack of trust, but only if paired with other reforms targeting transparency, accountability, and the middle class. Abundance is bigger than many of its proponents think. It’s not just an agenda about helping governments build. It’s an idea about making institutions work.

This is how you build an agenda that will do more than just win elections, or fix a party, but will instead reshape the debate in America. Our institutions need to fulfill critical missions. We must build more, produce more, and do more. Our leaders should be more responsive and effective. America must earn back faith and trust. Abundance should be a movement to do that with a meaningful agenda for national renewal and reform.

# Your Data in DOGE’s Hands

In its attempt to remake the federal bureaucracy, the Trump administration appears guided by three imperatives: Eliminate programs and agencies that do not fit into its agenda; exercise direct control over the remaining agencies; and enforce policies by coordinating across agencies. Political scientists sometimes refer to America as a “many-handed” state, where one hand does not necessarily know what the other hand is doing. The new goal is to punch towards a common opponent and throw multiple haymakers at once.

A key element of this strategy is increased data-sharing between federal agencies. For example, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) will now cooperate [directly](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/us/politics/irs-ice-tax-data-deal.html) with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to track down undocumented immigrants. ICE officers will be able to share the names of individuals with the IRS, which will then return a list of addresses and allow ICE officers to perform targeted local raids. IRS engineers have also begun [working with staffers](https://www.wired.com/story/palantir-doge-irs-mega-api-data/) from the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to build a new data-sharing interface that would give other federal agencies automated access to different taxpayer datasets.

[Subscribe now](https://www.persuasion.community/subscribe?)

At the same time, the Trump administration is leveraging federal data to make life less palatable for immigrants in the United States. Immigration authorities [asked](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/10/us/politics/migrants-deport-social-security-doge.html) the Social Security Administration (SSA) to add 6,300 new names to one of the most important federal datasets: the so-called “[death master file](https://fiscal.treasury.gov/files/dnp/20170804QRCDMF_FINALv2.pdf),” containing more than 94 million names of deceased individuals whose Social Security Numbers are no longer eligible to receive benefits. Data-sharing between immigration authorities and the SSA will initially focus on “terminating” the financial lives of individuals whom the Trump administration considers criminals or terrorists living in the United States. But it could broaden, according to government officials, to include anyone suspected of lacking proper documentation.

At the Department of Housing and Urban Development, meanwhile, officials are [merging](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/04/15/doge-ssa-immigration-trump-housing/) federal datasets—again with the help of DOGE staffers—to identify so-called “mixed-status” households in which some family members have legal status while others are undocumented, in order to ban them from receiving public housing benefits.

* * *

**It used to be** said that those who control the security forces control political power. Today, that power seems to lie disproportionately with those who control personal data. “Sysadmins”—workers who manage the vast troves of information that are under corporate or governmental control—have emerged as newly empowered operatives of the state.

Data-sharing between government agencies is one of DOGE’s key objectives. And in many ways, updating the handling and distribution of federal data is a noble endeavor. Much of the U.S. government runs on outdated legacy technologies, and (according to a 2023 [brief](https://www.aeaweb.org/content/file?id=18903) from the American Economic Association) government data “could serve policymakers and the public better if not for … agencies’ uneven access to key source data.”

But data sharing is also a potent weapon—or, rather, a key tactic in the weaponization of bureaucratic agencies as ideological enforcers. The biggest threats to privacy in the twenty-first century often do not come from the collection of any specific piece of information; they come from data linking. Information that was collected for a particular purpose by one organization can be used for a very different purpose by another organization, especially when it is merged with other data into a detailed personal profile. Individuals end up, in effect, with a digital twin, assembled from the informational footprints they leave behind.

* * *

* * *

In recent years, the role of the villain in this story has most commonly been played by large tech companies. As discussions of “surveillance capitalism” proliferated, so have stories about retailers [inferring a girl’s pregnancy](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2012/02/16/how-target-figured-out-a-teen-girl-was-pregnant-before-her-father-did/) before her parents learned about it, or about the [difficulties involved](https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna55073512) in making oneself invisible to Amazon’s watchful eye.

In comparison, information collected by the U.S. government remained relatively siloed.

Federal officials have long made a promise of confidentiality—that your personal data will be handled with care and will not be freely shared with other agencies—in part because mistrust in the bureaucratic handling of personal data increases the rate of tax evasion and reduces the accuracy of the Census. If people worry about the use of tax records by law enforcement, not filing a tax return can become a rational choice.

Crucially, this state of affairs was as much the result of _custom_ as it was of _statutes_. Many federal agencies are under a mandate to prevent the use of official records in ways that could target [specific individuals](https://www.census.gov/about/policies/privacy/statistical_safeguards.html)—but they still retain a large amount of discretionary authority to decide how, when, and with whom their records are shared. It’s just that they have, for the last one hundred years, chosen not to test the limits of that power.

* * *

**This paradigm** first emerged in the early 20th century. At that time, the U.S. government collected much less information about its citizens and non-citizens, but also shared this information much more freely. Women’s groups asked the Census Bureau for lists of local female residents. Industry groups requested business records. And during World War I, the Census Bureau worked with the Justice Department to identify individuals who were suspected of falsifying their ages to avoid the draft. If you asked for data, you stood a reasonably good chance of getting it.

This changed in large part because the public came to regard the Census with a considerable amount of suspicion and did not trust enumerators to handle their personal data with care. When the Census Bureau considered adding questions about personal finances and medical conditions, newspapers condemned the initiatives as a “new inquisition” and “a monstrous oppression.” Concerned lawyers organized a nationwide campaign that advised Americans to simply ignore the questions, and several members of Congress branded census questions about poverty and criminal records as “unwarranted and unconstitutional” because they could be used to aid the prosecution of petty crimes among their constituents.

Many American progressives of that era had initially been skeptical of, as the influential philosopher John Dewey put it, “all the early Victorian political platitudes” about individual rights and governmental overreach, and they had largely dismissed the idea that “liberty of thought and speech” could be permanently damaged by an overbearing state. In their eyes, the American government needed to be as assertive as it could be to address social inequalities and break up powerful monopolies.

But the experience of wartime censorship (and, later, of widespread police raids during the Prohibition Era) led progressives like Dewey to rediscover their liberal inclinations. Increasingly, legislative and regulatory constraints on the exercise of state power seemed like necessary protections against a state apparatus that was not just significantly larger than during the late nineteenth century but also significantly more capable of collecting, analyzing, and utilizing personal data.

In 1900, the Director of the Census still agreed to furnish the “name, age, sex, color, race, and birthplace of individuals” when government officials asked. But by 1930, the Attorney General declared that address data should not be shared with other federal agencies. In 1941, the Census Bureau refused to release information about Japanese-Americans to the Department of Justice. And in 1947, it denied requests for information about suspected Communist sympathizers, which had been sought by organizations like the House Un-American Activities Committee.

This paradigm was eventually formalized with the Privacy Act of 1974, which enjoyed bipartisan support and imposed additional limits on the handling of personal data by federal agencies. The law was a trade-off of sorts, balancing an administrative desire for detailed personal and statistical data against citizens’ expectations of privacy. As a result, during the routine course of government business state officials tended to do less than the law would conceivably allow them to do, and less than they were operationally capable of doing.

**The belief that** codified restrictions and institutional restraint are necessary to protect privacy has for some time been at odds with the ambitions of Silicon Valley, where personal data flows much more freely. It is therefore unsurprising that attempts to remake the administrative state are often led by DOGE staffers with a tech industry background. In the digital economy, data-linking is often welcomed by consumers, as digital services function better when data is shared across platforms. (If you used an online service to file your taxes this year, you will have undoubtedly noticed this: The filing process can be considerably sped up by allowing the tax software to pull data from financial services companies.) As the writer Franny Choi once [put it](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/01/03/opinion/franny-choi-privacy-poem.html), “truth is, I wanted to be known, cracked open by gentle hands.”

But transposing the info-politics of Silicon Valley onto public administration—and deploying personal data in a distinctly punitive fashion or towards narrow partisan ends—not only upends a century of precedent: it also threatens to undermine basic norms of American governance. Yes, siloed data can compromise the ability of the American state to deliver services and solve problems. But sometimes friction is a feature, not a bug. Impeding the flow of personal data is one tool that democratic institutions have at their disposal to protect the privacy of individuals. By doing so, they reinforce the principle that personal liberty is paramount.

**Martin Eiermann is a sociologist focused on the politics of personal data. His forthcoming book,** _**[The Limiting Principle](https://www.amazon.com/Limiting-Principle-Privacy-Became-Public/dp/0231218885/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0)**_**, examines the social and political significance of privacy in the modern United States.**

# Sarah Wynn-Williams's 'Careless People' ([permalink](https://pluralistic.net/2025/04/23/zuckerstreisand/#zdgaf))

I never would have read _Careless People_, Sarah Wynn-Williams's tell-all memoir about her years running global policy for Facebook, but then Meta's lawyer tried to get the book suppressed and secured an injunction to prevent her from promoting it:

[https://www.npr.org/2025/03/14/nx-s1-5318854/former-meta-executive-barred-from-discussing-criticism-of-the-company](https://www.npr.org/2025/03/14/nx-s1-5318854/former-meta-executive-barred-from-discussing-criticism-of-the-company)

So I've got something to thank Meta's lawyers for, because it's a great book! Not only is Wynn-Williams a skilled and lively writer who spills some of Facebook's most shameful secrets, but she's also a kick-ass narrator (I listened to the audiobook, which she voices):

[https://libro.fm/audiobooks/9781250403155-careless-people](https://libro.fm/audiobooks/9781250403155-careless-people)

I went into _Careless People_ with strong expectations about the kind of disgusting behavior it would chronicle. I have several friends who took senior jobs at Facebook, thinking they could make a difference (three of them actually appear in Wynn-Williams's memoir), and I've got a good sense of what a nightmare it is for a company.

But Wynn-Williams was a lot closer to three of the key personalities in Facebook's upper echelon than anyone in my orbit: Mark Zuckerberg, Sheryl Sandberg, and Joel Kaplan, who was elevated to VP of Global Policy after the Trump II election. I already harbor an atavistic loathing of these three based on their public statements and conduct, but the events Wynn-Williams reveals from their private lives make these three out to be beyond despicable. There's Zuck, whose underlings let him win at board-games like Settlers of Catan because he's a manbaby who can't lose (and who accuses Wynn-Williams of cheating when she fails to throw a game of Ticket to Ride while they're flying in his private jet). There's Sandberg, who demands the right to buy a kidney for her child from someone in Mexico, should that child ever need a kidney.

Then there's Kaplan, who is such an extraordinarily stupid and awful oaf that it's hard to pick out just one example, but I'll try. At one point, Wynn-Williams gets Zuck a chance to address the UN General Assembly. As is his wont, Zuck refuses to be briefed before he takes the dais (he's repeatedly described as unwilling to consider any briefing note longer than a single text message). When he gets to the mic, he spontaneously promises that Facebook will provide internet access to refugees all over the world. Various teams at Facebook then race around, trying to figure out whether this is something the company is actually doing, and once they realize Zuck was just bullshitting, set about trying to figure out how to do it. They get some way down this path when Kaplan intervenes to insist that giving away free internet to refugees is a bad idea, and that instead, they should _sell_ internet access to refugees. Facebookers dutifully throw themselves into this absurd project, which dies when Kaplan fires off an email stating that he's just realized that refugees don't have any money. The project dies.

The path that brought Wynn-Williams's into the company of these careless people is a weird – and rather charming – one. As a young woman, Wynn-Williams was a minor functionary in the New Zealand diplomatic corps, and during her foreign service, she grew obsessed with the global political and social potential of Facebook. She threw herself into the project of getting hired to work on Facebook's global team, working on strategy for liaising with governments around the world. The biggest impediment to landing this job is that it doesn't exist: sure, FB was lobbying the US government, but it was monumentally disinterested in the rest of the world in general, and the governments of the world in particular.

But Wynn-Williams persists, pestering potentially relevant execs with requests, working friends-of-friends (Facebook itself is extraordinarily useful for this), and refusing to give up. Then comes the Christchurch earthquake. Wynn-Williams is in the US, about to board a flight, when her sister, a news presenter, calls her while trapped inside a collapsed building (the sister hadn't been able to get a call through to anyone in NZ). Wynn-Williams spends the flight wondering if her sister is dead or alive, and only learns that her sister is OK through a post on Facebook.

The role Facebook played in the Christchurch quake transforms Wynn-Williams's passion for Facebook into something like religious zealotry. She throws herself into the project of landing the job, and she _does_, and after some funny culture-clashes arising from her Kiwi heritage and her public service background, she settles in at Facebook.

Her early years there are sometimes comical, sometimes scary, and are characteristic of a company that is growing quickly and unevenly. She's dispatched to Myanmar amidst a nationwide block of Facebook ordered by the ruling military junta and at one point, it seems like she's about to get kidnapped and imprisoned by goons from the communications ministry. She arranges for a state visit by NZ Prime Minister John Key, who wants a photo-op with Zuckerberg, who – oblivious to the prime minister standing right there in front of him – berates Wynn-Williams for demanding that he meet with some jackass politician (they do the photo-op anyway).

One thing is clear: Facebook doesn't really care about countries other than America. Though Wynn-Williams chalks this up to plain old provincial chauvinism (which FB's top eschelon possess in copious quantities), there's something else at work. The USA is the only country in the world that a) is rich, b) is populous, and c) has no meaningful privacy protections. If you make money selling access to dossiers on rich people to advertisers, America is the most important market in the world.

But then Facebook conquers America. Not only does FB saturate the US market, it uses its free cash-flow and high share price to acquire potential rivals, like Whatsapp and Instagram, ensuring that American users who leave Facebook (the service) remain trapped by Facebook (the company).

At this point, Facebook – Zuckerberg – turns towards the rest of the world. Suddenly, acquiring non-US users becomes a matter of urgency, and overnight Wynn-Williams is transformed from the sole weirdo talking about global markets to the key asset in pursuit of the company's top priority.

Wynn-Williams's explanation for this shift lies in Zuckerberg's personality, his need to constantly dominate (which is also why his subordinates have learned to let him win at board games). This is doubtless true: not only has this aspect of Zuckerberg's personality been on display in public for decades, Wynn-Williams was able to observe it first-hand, behind closed doors.

But I think that in addition to this personality defect, there's a _material_ pressure for Facebook to grow that Wynn-Williams doesn't mention. Companies that grow get extremely high price-to-earnings (P:E) ratios, meaning that investors are willing to spend many dollars on shares for every dollar the company takes in. Two similar companies with similar earnings can have vastly different valuations (the value of all the stock the company has ever issued), depending on whether one of them is still growing.

High P:E ratios reflect a bet on the part of investors that the company will continue to grow, and those bets only become more extravagant the more the company grows. This is a _huge_ advantage to companies with "growth stocks." If your shares constantly increase in value, they are highly liquid – that is, you can always find someone who's willing to buy your shares from you for cash, which means that you can treat shares _like_ cash. But growth stocks are _better_ than cash, because money grows slowly, if at all (especially in periods of extremely low interest rates, like the past 15+ years). Growth stocks, on the other hand, _grow_.

Best of all, companies with growth stocks have no trouble finding more stock when they need it. They just type zeroes into a spreadsheet and more shares appear. Contrast this with money. Facebook may take in a lot of money, but the money only arrives when _someone else_ spends it. Facebook's access to money is limited by exogenous factors – your willingness to send your money to Facebook. Facebook's access to shares is only limited by endogenous factors – the company's own willingness to issue new stock.

That means that when Facebook needs to buy something, there's a very good chance that the seller will accept Facebook's stock in lieu of US dollars. Whether Facebook is hiring a new employee or buying a company, it can outbid rivals who only have dollars to spend, because that bidder has to ask someone else for more dollars, whereas Facebook can make its own stock on demand. This is a _massive_ competitive advantage.

But it is also a _massive_ business risk. As Stein's Law has it, "anything that can't go on forever eventually stops." Facebook can't grow forever by signing up new users. Eventually, everyone who might conceivably have a Facebook account will get one. When that happens, Facebook will need to find some other way to make money. They could enshittify – that is, shift value from the company's users and customers to itself. They could invent something new (like metaverse, or AI). But if they can't make those things work, then the company's growth will have ended, and it will _instantaneously_ become grossly overvalued. Its P:E ratio will have to shift from the high value enjoyed by growth stocks to the low value endured by "mature" companies.

When that happens, anyone who is slow to sell will lose a _ton_ of money. So investors in growth stocks tend to keep one fist poised over the "sell" button and sleep with one eye open, watching for any hint that growth is slowing. It's not just that growth gives FB the power to outcompete rivals – it's _also_ the case that growth makes the company vulnerable to massive, sudden devaluations. What's more, if these devaluations are persistent and/or frequent enough, the key FB employees who accepted stock in lieu of cash for some or all of their compensation will either demand _lots_ more cash, or jump ship for a growing rival. These are the very same people that Facebook needs to pull itself out of its nosedives. For a growth stock, even small reductions in growth metrics (or worse, declines) can trigger cascades of compounding, mutually reinforcing collapse.

This is what happened in early 2022, when Meta posted slightly lower-than-anticipated US growth numbers, and the market all pounded on the "sell" button at once, lopping $250,000,000,000 of the company's valuation in 24 hours. At the time, it was the worst-ever single day losses for any company in human history:

[https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2022/02/03/facebook-faces-an-existential-moment-after-230-billion-stock-crash/](https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2022/02/03/facebook-faces-an-existential-moment-after-230-billion-stock-crash/)

Facebook's conquest of the US market triggered an emphasis on foreign customers, but not just because Zuck is obsessed with conquest. For Facebook, a decline in US growth posed an existential risk, the possibility of mass stock selloffs and with them, the end of the years in which Facebook could acquire key corporate rivals and executives with "money" it could print on the premises, on demand.

So Facebook cast its eye upon the world, and Wynn-Williams's long insistence that the company should be paying attention to the political situation abroad suddenly starts landing with her bosses. But those bosses – Zuck, Sandberg, Kaplan and others – are "careless." Zuck screws up opportunity after opportunity because he refuses to be briefed, forgets what little information he's been given, and blows key meetings because he refuses to get out of bed before noon. Sandberg's visits to Davos are undermined by her relentless need to promote herself, her "Lean In" brand, and her petty gamesmanship. Kaplan is the living embodiment of Green Day's "American Idiot" and can barely fathom that foreigners exist.

Wynn-Williams's adventures during this period are very well told, and are, by turns, harrowing and hilarious. Time and again, Facebook's top brass snatch defeat from the jaws of victory, squandering incredible opportunities that Wynn-Williams secures for them because of their pettiness, short-sightedness, and arrogance (that is, their carelessness).

But Wynn-Williams's disillusionment with Facebook isn't rooted in these frustrations. Rather, she is both personally and professionally aghast at the company's disgusting, callous and cruel behavior. She describes how her boss, Joel Kaplan, relentlessly sexually harasses her, and everyone in a position to make this stop tells her to shut up and take it. When Wynn-Williams give birth to her second child, she hemorrhages, almost dies, and ends up in a coma. Afterwards, Kaplan gives her a negative performance review because she was "unresponsive" to his emails and texts while she was dying in an ICU. This is a significant escalation of the earlier behavior she describes, like pestering her with personal questions about breastfeeding, video-calling her from bed, and so on (Kaplan is Sandberg's ex-boyfriend, and Wynn-Williams describes another creepy event where Sandberg pressures her to sleep next to her in the bedroom on one of Facebook's jets, something Wynn-Williams says she routinely does with the young women who report to her).

Meanwhile, Zuck is relentlessly pursuing Facebook's largest conceivable growth market: China. The only problem: China doesn't want Facebook. Zuck repeatedly tries to engineer meetings with Xi Jinping so he can plead his case in person. Xi is monumentally hostile to this idea. Zuck learns Mandarin. He studies Xi's book, conspicuously displays a copy of it on his desk. Eventually, he manages to sit next to Xi at a dinner where he begs Xi to name his next child. Xi turns him down.

After years of persistent nagging, lobbying, and groveling, Facebook's China execs start to make progress with a state apparatchik who dangles the possibility of Facebook entering China. Facebook promises this factotum the world – all the surveillance and censorship the Chinese state wants and more. Then, Facebook's contact in China is jailed for corruption, and they have to start over.

At this point, Kaplan has punished Wynn-Williams – she blames it on her attempts to get others to force him to stop his sexual harassment – and cut her responsibilities in half. He tries to maneuver her into taking over the China operation, something he knows she absolutely disapproves of and has refused to work on – but she refuses. Instead, she is put in charge of hiring the new chief of China operations, giving her access to a voluminous paper-trail detailing the company's dealings with the Chinese government.

According to Wynn-Williams, Facebook actually built an extensive censorship and surveillance system for the Chinese state – spies, cops and military – to use against Chinese Facebook users, and FB users globally. They promise to set up caches of global FB content in China that the Chinese state can use to monitor all Facebook activity, everywhere, with the implication that they'll be able to spy on private communications, and censor content for non-Chinese users.

Despite all of this, Facebook is never given access to China. However, the Chinese state _is_ able to use the tools Facebook built for it to attack independence movements, the free press and dissident uprisings in Hong Kong and Taiwan.

Meanwhile, in Myanmar, a genocide is brewing. NGOs and human rights activists keep reaching out to Facebook to get them to pay attention to the widespread use of the platform to whip up hatred against the country's Muslim minority group, the Rohinga. Despite having expended tremendous amounts of energy to roll out "Free Basics" in Myanmar (a program whereby Facebook bribes carriers to exclude its own services from data caps), with the result that in Myanmar, "the internet" is synonymous with "Facebook," the company has not expended _any_ effort to manage its Burmese presence. The entire moderation staff consists of one (later two) Burmese speakers who are based in Dublin and do not work local hours (later, these two are revealed as likely stooges for the Myanmar military junta, who are behind the genocide plans).

The company has also failed to invest in Burmese language support for its systems – posts written in Burmese script are not stored as Unicode, meaning that none of the company's automated moderation systems can parse it. The company is so hostile to pleas to upgrade these systems that Wynn-Williams and some colleagues create secret, private Facebook groups where they can track the failures of the company and the rising tide of lethal violence in the country (this isn't the only secret dissident Facebook group that Wynn-Williams joins – she's also part of a group of women who have been sexually harassed by colleagues and bosses).

The genocide that follows is horrific beyond measure. And, as with the Trump election, the company's initial posture is that they couldn't possibly have played a significant role in a real-world event that shocked and horrified its rank-and-file employees.

The company, in other words, is "careless." Warned of imminent harms to its users, to democracy, to its own employees, the top executives simply do not care. They ignore the warnings and the consequences, or pay lip service to them. They don't care.

Take Kaplan: after figuring out that the company can't curry favor with the world's governments by selling drone-delivered wifi to refugees (the drones don't fly and the refugees are broke), he hits on another strategy. He remakes "government relations" as a _sales office_, selling political ads to politicians who are seeking to win over voters, or, in the case of autocracies, disenfranchised hostage-citizens. This is hugely successful, both as a system for securing government cooperation and as a way to transform Facebook's global policy shop from a cost-center to a profit-center.

But of course, it has a price. Kaplan's best customers are dictators and would-be dictators, formenters of hatred and genocide, authoritarians seeking opportunities to purge their opponents, through exile and/or murder.

Wynn-Williams makes a very good case that Facebook is run by awful people who are also very careless – in the sense of being _reckless_, incurious, indifferent.

But there's another meaning to "careless" that lurks just below the surface of this excellent memoir: "careless" in the sense of "arrogant" – in the sense of not caring about the consequences of their actions.

To me, this was the most important – but least-developed – lesson of _Careless People_. When Wynn-Williams lands at Facebook, she finds herself surrounded by oafs and sociopaths, cartoonishly selfish and shitty people, who, _nevertheless_, have built a service that she _loves_ and values, along with hundreds of millions of other people.

She's not wrong to be excited about Facebook, or its potential. The company may be run by careless people, but they are still _prudent_, behaving as though the consequences of screwing up matter. They are "careless" in the sense of "being reckless," but they _care_, in the sense of having a healthy fear (and thus respect) for what might happen if they fully yield to their reckless impulses.

Wynn-Williams's firsthand account of the next decade is not a story of these people becoming more reckless, rather, its a story in which the possibility of consequences for that recklessness recedes, and with it, so does their care over those consequences.

Facebook buys its competitors, freeing it from market consequences for its bad acts. By buying the places where disaffected Facebook users are seeking refuge – Instagram and Whatsapp – Facebook is able to insulate itself from the discipline of competition – the fear that doing things that are adverse to its users will cause them to flee.

Facebook captures its regulators, freeing it from regulatory consequences for its bad acts. By playing a central role in the electoral campaigns of Obama and then other politicians around the world, Facebook transforms its watchdogs into supplicants who are more apt to beg it for favors than hold it to account.

Facebook tames its employees, freeing it from labor consequences for its bad acts. As engineering supply catches up with demand, Facebook's leadership come to realize that they don't have to worry about workforce uprisings, whether incited by impunity for sexually abusive bosses, or by the company's complicity in genocide and autocratic oppression.

First, Facebook becomes too big to fail.

Then, Facebook becomes too big to jail.

Finally, Facebook becomes too big to _care_.

This is the "carelessness" that ultimately changes Facebook for the worse, that turns it into the hellscape that Wynn-Williams is eventually fired from after she speaks out once too often. Facebook bosses aren't just "careless" because they refuse to read a briefing note that's longer than a tweet. They're "careless" in the sense that they arrive at a juncture where they don't have to care who they harm, whom they enrage, who they ruin.

There's a telling anaecdote near the end of _Careless People_. Back in 2017, leaks revealed that Facebook's sales-reps were promising advertisers the ability to market to teens who felt depressed and "worthless":

[https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/05/facebook-helped-advertisers-target-teens-who-feel-worthless/](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/05/facebook-helped-advertisers-target-teens-who-feel-worthless/)

Wynn-Williams is – rightly – aghast about this, and even more aghast when she sees the company's official response, in which they disclaim any knowledge that this capability was being developed and fire a random, low-level scapegoat. Wynn-Williams knows they're lying. She knows that this is a routine offering, one that the company routinely boasts about to advertisers.

But she doesn't mention the _other_ lies that Facebook tells in this moment: for one thing, the company offers advertisers the power to target more teens than actually _exist_. The company proclaims the efficacy of its "sentiment analysis" tool that knows how to tell if teens are feeling depressed or "worthless," even though these tools are notoriously inaccurate, hardly better than a coin-toss, a kind of digital phrenology.

Facebook, in other words, isn't just lying to the public about what it offers to advertisers – it's lying to advertisers, too. Contra those who say, "if you're not paying for the product, you're the product," Facebook treats _anyone_ it can get away with abusing as "the product" (just like every other tech monopolist):

[https://pluralistic.net/2022/11/14/luxury-surveillance/#liar-liar](https://pluralistic.net/2022/11/14/luxury-surveillance/#liar-liar)

Wynn-Williams documents so many instances in which Facebook's top executives lie – to the courts, to Congress, to the UN, to the press. Facebook lies when it is beneficial to do so – but only when they can get away with it. By the time Facebook was lying to advertisers about its depressed teen targeting tools, it was already colluding with Google to rig the ad market with an illegal tool called "Jedi Blue":

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jedi\_Blue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jedi_Blue)

Facebook's story is the story of a company that set out to become _too big to care_, and achieved that goal. The company's abuses track precisely with its market dominance. It enshittified things for users once it had the users locked in. It screwed advertisers once it captured their market. It did the media-industry-destroying "pivot to video" fraud once it captured the media:

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pivot\_to\_video](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pivot_to_video)

The important thing about Facebook's carelessness is that it wasn't the result of the many grave personality defects in Facebook's top executives – it was the result of policy choices. Government decisions not to enforce antitrust law, to allow privacy law to wither on the vine, to expand IP law to give Facebook a weapon to shut down interoperable rivals – these all created the enshittogenic environment that allowed the careless people who run Facebook to stop caring.

The corollary: if we change the policy environment, we can make these careless people – and their successors, who run other businesses we rely upon – _care_. They may never care about _us_, but we can make them care about what we might do to _them_ if they give in to their carelessness.

Meta is in global regulatory crosshairs, facing antitrust action in the USA:

And muscular enforcement pledges in the EU:

As Martin Luther King, Jr put it:

> The law cannot make a man love me, but it can stop him from lynching me, and I think that's pretty important.

![The Basic Books cover for Adam Becker's 'More Everything Forever.'](https://i0.wp.com/craphound.com/images/more-everything-faster.jpg?w=840&ssl=1)

# More Everything Forever ([permalink](https://pluralistic.net/2025/04/22/vinges-bastards/#cyberpunk-is-a-warning-not-a-suggestion))

ForeverAstrophysicist Adam Becker knows a few things about science and technology – enough to show, in a new book called _More Everything Forever_ that the claims that tech bros make about near-future space colonies, brain uploading, and other skiffy subjects are all nonsense dressed up as prediction:

[https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/adam-becker/more-everything-forever/9781541619593/](https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/adam-becker/more-everything-forever/9781541619593/)

Becker investigates the personalities, the ideologies, the coalitions, the histories, and crucially, the _grifts_ behind such science fictional pursuits as infinite life-extension, space colonization, automation panic, AI doomerism, longtermism, effective altruism, rationalism, and conciousness uploading.

This is, loosely speaking, the bundle of ideologies that Timnit Gebru and Émile P. Torres dubbed TESCREAL (transhumanism, Extropianism, singularitarianism, (modern) cosmism, Rationalism, Effective Altruism, and longtermism):

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TESCREAL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TESCREAL)

While these are largely associated with modern Silicon Valley esoteric techbros (and the odd Oxfordian like Nick Bostrom), they have very deep roots, which Becker excavates – like Nikolai Fyodorov's 18th century "cosmism," a project to "scientifically" resurrect everyone who ever lived inside of a simulation:

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolai\_Fyodorov\_(philosopher)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolai_Fyodorov_\(philosopher\))

In their modern incarnation, these ideas largely originate in science fiction novels. That is to say, they were made up and popularized by people like me, the vast majority of whom made no pretense of being able to predict the future or even realistically describe a path from the present to the future they were presenting. Science fiction is something between a card trick and a consensual con game, where the writer shows you just enough detail to make you think that the rest of it must be lurking somewhere in the wings. No one in sf has ever explained how consciousness uploading could possibly work, and neither have any of the advocates for consciousness uploading – the difference is that (most of) the sf writers know they're just making stuff up.

Becker's central question is how many "smart" people (some of them very smart and accomplished, others merely very certain that they are smart despite all evidence to the contrary) can mistake futuristic allegories made up by pulp writers for prophesy?

In answering this question, he uncovers a corollary of Upton Sinclair's famous maxim that "it is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends on his not understanding it," namely, that "it is easy to get a person to believe something when doing so will make them feel good about themselves."

The beliefs that Becker explores in this book sometimes make the believers rich (like the AI grifters who run around shouting about AI taking over the world and turning us all into paperclips). Sometimes, they make their believers feel good about being selfish assholes (like longtermism, which holds that all the misery in the world today is worth it if you can make 24 heptillion hypothetical simulated people just a little happy in 10,000 years). Sometimes, they make their believers feel good about life after death, or eternal life – the same pitch that religions have been roping in followers with since the stone age.

What differentiates these beliefs from other faith-based claims is that their followers claim that they aren't operating on faith, but on science, reason and rationality. This is where the fact that Becker is a bona fide astrophysicist comes in. Not only is he personally qualified to debunk claims about space colonization, but he's also familiar with the rigorous process of scientific inquiry, and capable of consulting experts and listening to them. That's how he concludes, for example, that having your head cut off and frozen when you die is just a form of corpse mutilation, with a zero point zero zero zero zero percent chance of someone recovering your mind from your freezerburned brain.

Like his subjects, Becker has a complicated relationship with science fiction. He, too, enjoys the imaginative flights of the genre, its delightful thought-experiments, its gnarly moral conundra. I love these too. They make for a fascinating and often useful lens for understanding and challenging our own relationship with technology and our very humanity. Ultimately, Becker is exploring the difference between reading sf because it makes you think in new ways, and reading sf as a kind of prophetic text, and – crucially – he's asserting that it's perfectly possible to enjoy this stuff without organizing your moral life around hypothetical heptillions of virtual people living in the year 25,000; or, indeed, having your head cut off and frozen.

# Trump's FTC opens the floodgates for tariff profiteering ([permalink](https://pluralistic.net/2025/04/21/trumpflation/#andrew-ferguson))

Have you heard that tariffs are going to drive prices up? Me too. There's a good reason we're hearing a lot of talk about tariffs prices: tariffs are a tax that is ultimately paid by consumers. Trump plans to raise $6t in tariffs, making them the largest tax increase in US history:

[https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2025/04/03/as-trump-throws-the-world-economy-into-chaos-with-his-tariff-trade-war-heres-what-ohio-can-expect/](https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2025/04/03/as-trump-throws-the-world-economy-into-chaos-with-his-tariff-trade-war-heres-what-ohio-can-expect/)

But that $6t is just for starters. If there's one thing we learned from the pandemic supply-chain shocks, it's that corporate CEOs never let an emergency go to waste. Bosses, knowing that you'd been warned to expect higher prices, went ahead and jacked up their prices _way_ over inflation, blaming it on covid, on stimulus checks, on Biden, on the phase of the moon. Blaming it on anything – except greed. That's why we called it "excuseflation":

[https://pluralistic.net/2023/03/11/price-over-volume/#pepsi-pricing-power](https://pluralistic.net/2023/03/11/price-over-volume/#pepsi-pricing-power)

How do we know that bosses were jacking up prices? They told us so! In investor calls, corporate executives boasted that "consumer expectations" gave them "pricing power," and that they were making bank from it. From oil to eggs, excuseflation – greedflation – is everywhere:

[https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/23/cant-make-an-omelet/#keep-calm-and-crack-on](https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/23/cant-make-an-omelet/#keep-calm-and-crack-on)

Neoclassical economists insist that this is impossible. For greedflation to be real, companies would have to somehow collude to raise prices. After all, if prices go up for one seller and not another, shoppers will follow the invisible hand as it points them to those bargains. There's some truth to that, in a competitive market. But what if we were to waste 40 years, waving through anticompetitive mergers until most sectors of the economy were dominated by five or fewer companies:

[https://www.openmarketsinstitute.org/learn/monopoly-by-the-numbers](https://www.openmarketsinstitute.org/learn/monopoly-by-the-numbers)

When a sector is controlled by a handful of firms, there's plenty of opportunities for "tacit collusion." And not all the collusion is tacit: in concentrated sectors, all the C-suite types know each other. They've worked with each other for their whole careers, jumping from one company to another. They're godparents to each others' children, executors of one-another's estate, members of the same polycules. No wonder the Communist revolutionary Adam Smith wrote:

> People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or in some contrivance to raise prices.

But we live in the computer age. We aren't cavemen, confined to whispering price information to one another with our flapping meat-mouths. We have _computers_! Better still, we have _data brokers_, who allow for collusive price-raising, gather price data from all the dominant players in a sector, then "advising" each company on how to set its prices. Somehow, the optimal, coordinate pricing strategy is always to make prices _higher_. That's true with meat:

[https://pluralistic.net/2023/10/04/dont-let-your-meat-loaf/#meaty-beaty-big-and-bouncy](https://pluralistic.net/2023/10/04/dont-let-your-meat-loaf/#meaty-beaty-big-and-bouncy)

And it's true with rent:

[https://pluralistic.net/2024/12/11/nimby-yimby-fimby/#home-team-advantage](https://pluralistic.net/2024/12/11/nimby-yimby-fimby/#home-team-advantage)

This kind of third-party price-rigging is illegal, of course, but decades of antitrust neglect allowed these "economic termites" to multiply and fill the walls of our society:

[https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/economic-termites-are-everywhere](https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/economic-termites-are-everywhere)

But never let it be said that monopolists can't innovate. Thanks to the total failure of Congress to pass consumer privacy legislation since 1988, the humble price-fixing data-broker has transformed into the "surveillance pricing" industry:

[https://pluralistic.net/2024/06/05/your-price-named/#privacy-first-again](https://pluralistic.net/2024/06/05/your-price-named/#privacy-first-again)

With surveillance pricing, sellers buy your financial data from the unregulated data-broker industry and use it to set a different price for every customer. For example, McDonald's has invested in a company called "Plexure" that can tell when someone at the drive-through has just been paid, so that the seller can add a dollar to the price of their daily breakfast sandwich. And surveillance pricing isn't limited to buyers – sellers can get surveillance-priced, too. Take nurses, whose staffing agencies have been replaced by a cartel of three apps that buy nurses' credit data before offering them a shift, so that they can offer a lower wage to nurses carrying high credit-card debts (indebted, desperate workers will sell their labor for less):

[https://pluralistic.net/2024/12/18/loose-flapping-ends/#luigi-has-a-point](https://pluralistic.net/2024/12/18/loose-flapping-ends/#luigi-has-a-point)

The industry calls this "personalized pricing," and they tout the possibility that it will result in poorer people getting bargains from sellers who know just how little they can afford. In their telling, it's a kind of cod-Marxism, organized around "to each according to their ability (to pay)":

[https://pluralistic.net/2025/01/11/socialism-for-the-wealthy/#rugged-individualism-for-the-poor](https://pluralistic.net/2025/01/11/socialism-for-the-wealthy/#rugged-individualism-for-the-poor)

There's precious little evidence that personalized pricing is _lowering_ anyone's prices. Indeed, the main benefit of personalized pricing – apart from price-gouging, that is – is that it's hard to detect. When prices are different for every customer, how does a customer know they're getting ripped off?

That's what Biden's FTC set out to discover. Last summer, they opened an investigation into surveillance pricing, with the goal of cracking down on the practice:

[https://pluralistic.net/2024/07/24/gouging-the-all-seeing-eye/#i-spy](https://pluralistic.net/2024/07/24/gouging-the-all-seeing-eye/#i-spy)

Then came the election, and a change in leadership at the FTC. Out with Lina Khan, the most effective FTC chair in generations, in with Andrew Ferguson, the decidedly mid Trump footsoldier whose first official act was to kill the surveillance pricing investigation and replace it with an internal snitch-line where FTC employees could report each other for being "woke":

[https://pluralistic.net/2025/01/24/enforcement-priorities/#enemies-lists](https://pluralistic.net/2025/01/24/enforcement-priorities/#enemies-lists)

This is a damned shame, because the country's largest, most successful "pricing consultancies" – like PROS Holding – are advising their clients to get ready to jack up prices in order to take advantage of consumer expectations of inflation from tariffs, as Katya Schwenk reports for _The Lever_:

[https://www.levernews.com/how-trump-is-helping-price-gougers-exploit-his-tariffs/](https://www.levernews.com/how-trump-is-helping-price-gougers-exploit-his-tariffs/)

You don't have to take Schwenk's word for it. You can watch pricing guru Craig Zawada's webinar for yourself:

[https://pros.com/learn/webinars/navigating-tariff-increases-future-proof-pricing-strategy](https://pros.com/learn/webinars/navigating-tariff-increases-future-proof-pricing-strategy)

Zawada works for PROS Holdings, a notorious price-setting technology provider. In the webinar, Zawada tells viewers that thanks to tariffs, "there is perhaps more of a window to make changes to your pricing than there has been before…customers expect change. Now is the time to take advantage."

Of course, you're the one he wants them to take advantage of.

PROS is one of the firms targeted by Khan's FTC and let off the hook under Ferguson. A former FTC official summed it up nicely: "The message that is coming out of this administration… is that the watchdog is gone and companies feel emboldened to rip people off. It’s open season on American consumers."

What's open season look like? Pricing consultant Drew Marconi hosted a webinar where he advised clients "You may just have to rip the Band-Aid — jack up prices and see what happens. You’re going to be surprised by how much room you have":

[https://www.linkedin.com/events/7315531163840774144/comments/](https://www.linkedin.com/events/7315531163840774144/comments/)

And the firms are listening. Autozone's last 2024 earnings call included this reassuring news: "if we get tariffs… we’ll generally raise prices ahead of — \[when\] we know what the tariffs will be":

[https://seekingalpha.com/article/4723049-autozone-inc-azo-q4-2024-earnings-call-transcript](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4723049-autozone-inc-azo-q4-2024-earnings-call-transcript)

Pricing consultants are advising their clients against charging "tariff surcharges," noting that customers will expect these to go away when (if) the tariffs end. Instead, they advise businesses to raise prices in expectation of "faster, lasting implementation of price increases":

[https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/10/30/companies-tariffs-trump-prices/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/10/30/companies-tariffs-trump-prices/)

Ferguson has warned that the FTC will crack down on tariff profiteers who raise prices over and above the additional costs imposed by tariffs. But he said this even as he was shutting down the agency's investigations into the companies that facilitate exactly this kind of profiteering. Still, Ferguson _is_ ridding the FTC of "woke." I'm sure that'll be a comfort to Americans as they fill in a loan application so they can afford a new tire for their car.

# Trump team signals possibility of lower tariffs on PRC goods; Xi on climate; China working the EU; China-Russia financial sanctions evasion

*Source: <https://sinocism.com/p/trump-teams-signals-possibility-of>*
*Published: 2025-04-23T23:33:03.000Z*

Earlier today I published this week’s episode of Sharp China - [Bessent and an ‘Unsustainable’ Path; Making Sense of Hourly Madness; The PRC’s Message to the World; A Note on Canada](https://sinocism.com/p/sharp-china-bessent-and-an-unsustainable). We discussed Tuesday’s signals that the Trump administration may seek to deescalate its trade war, why Beijing may see it as confirmation that their patient approach is working, and questions about what’s next as the Trump messaging on trade changes by the day.

And then today, amidst all the noise about where the US-China trade war may be heading, one “senior official” told the [Wall Street Journal that](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/white-house-considers-slashing-china-tariffs-to-de-escalate-trade-war-6f875d69?mod=china_news_article_pos1):

> the China tariffs were likely to come down to between roughly 50% and 65%. The administration is also considering a tiered approach similar to the one proposed by the House committee on China late last year: 35% levies for items the U.S. deems not a threat to national security, and at least 100% for items deemed as strategic to America’s interest, some of the people said. The bill proposed phasing in those levies over five years.

Administration officials then said that the US would not cut the rates unilaterally, but no one has yet articulated how they are going to get the Chinese side to cut their rates simultaneously, or when there may actually be talks. I do not see any scenario in which Xi agrees to cut first, or even simultaneously, without extracting something from the US side. Xi waiting even five minutes longer than Trump to reduce the tariffs would be a win for him domestically and globally.

As we [discussed on Sharp China](https://sinocism.com/p/sharp-china-bessent-and-an-unsustainable), Trump seemingly negotiating with itself in public is probably not going to help convince other countries to agree to tough measures on the PRC while they have no idea where the US and China will ultimately land.

Are likely impending shortages in the US, as the Flexport CEO [discussed on Twitter](https://x.com/typesfast/status/1915040431693595131) today, among the factors motivating President Trump to look for a way to walk things back?

#### **Summary of today’s top items:**

**1\. [Trump team signals possibility of lower tariffs on PRC goods](https://sinocism.com/i/161985248/trump-teams-signals-possibility-of-lower-tariffs-on-prc-goods)**

**2\. [US Treasury Secretary calls out China in speech about the IMF and World Bank](https://sinocism.com/i/161985248/us-treasury-secretary-calls-out-china-in-speech-about-the-imf-and-world-bank) -** Secretary Bessent [told](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sb0094) the audience at the Institute of International Finance that:

> China, in particular, is in need of a rebalancing. Recent data shows the Chinese economy tilting even further away from consumption toward manufacturing. China’s economic system, with growth driven by manufacturing exports, will continue to create even more serious imbalances with its trading partners if the status quo is allowed to continue.
>
> China’s current economic model is built on exporting its way out of its economic troubles. It’s an unsustainable model that is not only harming China but the entire world.
>
> China needs to change. The country knows it needs to change. Everyone knows it needs to change. And we want to help it change—because we need rebalancing too.
>
> China can start by moving its economy away from export overcapacity, and toward supporting its own consumers and domestic demand. Such a shift would help with the global rebalancing that the world desperately needs...
>
> The IMF must be a brutal truth-teller, and not just to some members. Instead, today’s IMF has been whistling past the graveyard. Its 2024 External Sector Report was entitled “Imbalances Receding.” This pollyannish outlook is symptomatic of an institution more dedicated to preserving the status quo than asking the hard questions...
>
> In line with its core mandate, the IMF needs to call out countries like China that have pursued globally distortive policies and opaque currency practices for many decades.

He also said that the World Bank “treating China—the second-largest economy in the world—as a “developing country” is absurd”, and declared that “no one who financed or supplied the Russian war machine will be eligible for funds earmarked for Ukraine’s reconstruction.” That would seem to rule out China.

**3\. [Xi’s speech to the Leaders Meeting on Climate and the Just Transition](https://sinocism.com/i/161985248/xis-speech-to-the-leaders-meeting-on-climate-and-the-just-transition) -**Xi spoke via video link to the Leaders Meeting on Climate and the Just Transition. According to the Guardian it was “a closed-door virtual meeting with the UN secretary general, António Guterres, Brazil’s president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, and about a dozen other heads of state and government to discuss the climate crisis”. No one from the US attended.

Xi pledged that “no matter how the international situation changes, China’s actions to tackle climate change will not slow down, its efforts to promote international cooperation will not weaken, and its practice of building a community with a shared future for mankind will not stop. China is willing to work with all parties to earnestly fulfill the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, do its best, unite, and cooperate to promote the building of a clean, beautiful, and sustainable world.”

He also took a swipe at the Trump administration:

> Xi Jinping pointed out that this year marks the 10th anniversary of the conclusion of the Paris Agreement and the 80th anniversary of the founding of the United Nations. At present, the world is experiencing accelerating changes unseen in a century, and human society is at a new crossroads. Despite the fact that certain major powers are indulging in unilateralism and protectionism, seriously impacting international rules and the international order, history always moves forward through twists and turns. As long as we maintain firm confidence and strengthen unity and cooperation, we can overcome the headwinds and push global climate governance and all progressive causes of humanity toward long-term and stable advancement.

**4\. [China to drop sanctions on members of the European Parliament?](https://sinocism.com/i/161985248/china-to-drop-sanctions-on-members-of-the-european-parliament) -** Noah Barkin of the Rhodium Group broke the [news earlier today](https://nbarkin.substack.com/p/china-may-lift-sanctions-that-sunk) that “China may be preparing to lift its sanctions on members of the European Parliament (MEPs) as early as next week”. Chinese officials apparently hope that dropping those sanctions, though not the other ones on think tanks and researchers, might help revive negotiations over the EU-China Comprehensive Agreement on Investment (CAI). That seems unlikely, but it would be an interesting move by the Chinese side. Noah has long written the excellent Watching China in Europe newsletter, and now he has [relaunched it on Substack](https://nbarkin.substack.com/). I highly recommend it.

**5\. [China and Russia build a payments system to avoid sanctions](https://sinocism.com/i/161985248/china-and-russia-build-a-payments-system-to-avoid-sanctions) -** Reuters [reports](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/china-track-bank-netting-system-shields-russia-china-trade-western-eyes-2025-04-22/) that big “Russian banks have set up a netting payments system dubbed "The China Track" for transactions with China” that was “ set up by major sanctioned banks and involves a web of intermediaries registered in countries that Russia considers friendly”.

**Show Notes:**

On today’s show Andrew and Bill begin with Tuesday’s signals that the Trump administration may seek to deescalate its trade war, why Beijing may see it as confirmation that their patient approach is working, and questions about what’s next as the Trump messaging on trade changes by the day. From there: The PRC warns countries about cooperating with the US, and why the apparent US flip-flopping likely hurts their cause with third-party countries. At the end: A dispatch from Yiwu, more on PRC messages to third-party countries, and a listener’s note on Trump’s caustic approach to Canada.

# US again signals desire for a China trade deal; More limits on rare earths-related exports to US; Myanmar; JD takes on Meituan

*Source: <https://sinocism.com/p/us-again-signals-desire-for-a-china>*
*Published: 2025-04-22T22:32:52.000Z*

It is World Bank week here in DC and so there are lots of foreign economic and financial officials and big investors in town. Earlier today JPMorgan held a private meeting at which US Treasury Secretary Bessent spoke. Bloomberg broke the story about his comments on the US-China trade war, writing:

> Bessent told a closed-door investor summit Tuesday that the tariff standoff with China cannot be sustained by both sides and that the world’s two largest economies will have to find ways to de-escalate.
>
> That de-escalation will come in the very near future, Bessent said during an event hosted by JPMorgan Chase & Co. in Washington, which wasn’t open to the public or media. He characterized the current situation as essentially a trade embargo, according to people who attended the session.

But then the cleanup began, with reports from the Financial Times and [Fox Business](https://x.com/CGasparino/status/1914745637624848832) that people are reading too much into his comments.

And from the [Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/780cbf25-5f0a-48c3-a80e-cf97f7b71fd7):

Eamon Javers of [CNBC obtained](https://x.com/EamonJavers/status/1914732957912137858) what he said was a rough transcript of Bessent’s comments. This section sounds like what Trump tried and failed to get in his first term, and then had to settle for a disappointing purchase deal while kicking structural reforms to a Phase 2 that was never going to happen, and did not happen:

I believe the report from about six months ago to which Bessent referred is “[The China Shock: Learning from Labor Market Adjustment to Large Changes in Trade](https://www.nber.org/papers/w21906)” from the National Bureau of Economic Research.

PRC Minister of Finance Lan Fo’an will be in DC for part of this week to attend the World Bank meetings, so perhaps there could be a meeting, but if there is not that is probably another sign of no actual progress towards even discussions to talk about an off-ramp. I am skeptical there will be a meeting.

Given the audience - representatives of some of the biggest capitalist organizations in the world - it is not a stretch to imagine Bessent’s comments will be seen by PRC policymakers as another sign that US resolve is weakening, especially on a day when the Wall Street Journal leads with this headline:

# Against Horizontal Scroll

# Against Horizontal Scroll Apr 22, 2025

What’s in common between these two blog posts (pardon me, my fellow crustaceans of lobster variety)?

![](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f55cb0fa-2410-4c92-82c6-f2411aa313f5) ![](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f7b4bfc7-eee2-4d30-9133-aee51750db4f)

They both have horizontal scroll on mobile! Horizontal scroll is very distracting – when you scroll vertically with your thumb, you necessarily scroll horizontally as well. Any amount of horizontal scroll clips the left edge of the screen, chopping of begging of every sentence!

This is a hard problem to fix, or at least I don’t know a reliable simple solution. Still, I think this site should not have overflows, so let me share some things I’ve learned about the width of things!

## [Code Blocks](#Code-Blocks)

In general, you want your main text to be pretty narrow, about 50-60 characters. This creates a problem for coding blogs — code, unlike prose, wants to be a bit wider. While its a good idea to keep most of the examples narrow, an occasional line still wants to be longer than 60. My suggested solution here is to accept this, and allow code samples to be wider than the main text. This is not super trivial to achieve with CSS, but I borrowed a solution from [https://blog.xoria.org](https://blog.xoria.org).

My HTML structure looks roughly like this, `body` > `main` > `article` > `section?` > `p`:

    <body>
      <main>
        <article>
        <h1>
          Against Horizontal Scroll <time class="meta" datetime="2025-04-22">Apr 22, 2025</time>
        </h1>
        <p>
          What’s in common between these two blog posts (pardon me, my fellow
          crustaceans of lobster variety)?
        </p>
        <figure class="code-block">
          <pre><code>A bunch of code here.</code></pre>
        </figure>
        </article>
      </main>
    </body>

And I use the following CSS for narrow main text width and moderately wide code:

    /* Set the body width to how wide you want the code to be */
    body {
        max-width: 80ch;
        padding: 2ch;
        margin-left: auto;
        margin-right: auto;
    }

    /* Then, limit every "paragraph" of article to be narrower.
     * Paragraph is just any descendant of the main article tag.
     */
    article > *,
    article > section > *
    { max-width: 55ch; }

    /* Finally, opt-out of narrow width for figures with code */
    article > section,
    article > figure,
    article > section > figure
    { max-width: 80ch; }

Still, it is hard to enforce that _all_ code samples fit within the limit, and there are narrow screens where they can’t physically fit.

To solve this, you need to make sure that, when a horizontal scroll-bar appears due to a wide code block, it only appears on the code block, and not on the entire website:

    figure.code-block > pre > code {
        overflow-x: auto;
    }

Code blocks are the primary cause of horizontal scroll, so it’s great that this is fixed now! Two more left!

## [Word Breaking](#Word-Breaking)

The browser can reflow your article to make it narrower by breaking text over multiple lines. This requires that your words are not too wide. This is usually not a problem, unless you are a German, but there are certain technical “words” that are, in fact, wide. For example, I like to use bare URLs in my writing, and, because urls typically do not contain spaces, they can’t be broken over multiple lines and cause scrollbars. For such cases, you need to inform the browser that it is okay to break the thing anywhere:

    p { hyphens: auto; }
    a.url { word-break: break-all; }

## [Flexbox](#Flexbox)

The final issue that hit me relates to flexbox. Specifically, its `min-width` semantics. If you don’t specify `min-width` of a flex item explicitly, it gets defaulted to `min-width: auto`. This means that the _minimum_ width that the item can occupy is determined by _not_ breaking paragraphs in lines! This way, the computed minimal width of the element ends up being much wider than what you would naturally expect. To fix it, manually override it:

    aside.admn > div { flex: 1; min-width: 0; }

That’s all for today. To underscore my point, and in solidarity with the authors of the two blogs that started this, let me include an url without `word-break` to make sure this article itself has the problem it talks about:

# A Fun Zig Program

*Source: <https://matklad.github.io/2025/04/21/fun-zig-program.html>*
*Published: 2025-04-21T00:00:00.000Z*

# A Fun Zig Program Apr 21, 2025

This short example is worth pondering a bit if you are learning Zig:

    fn f(comptime x: bool) if (x) u32 else bool {
        return if (x) 0 else false;
    }

    const print = @import("std").debug.print;
    pub fn main() void {
        print("{} {}", .{f(false), f(true)});
    }

It is curious in three ways:

*   You can write arbitrary expressions in type position.
*   In functions, type expressions can use preceding `comptime` parameters.
*   Functions _must_ specify the signature, there’s no type inference, no `-> auto`. When a generic function is called, Zig first computes the signature. While doing so, it ignores function’s body. Afterwards, the compiler separately checks that the signature is correct for the call site, and that the body is correct for the signature.

# Monday Morning Haskell: Solve.hs Module 4 Now Available!

*Source: <https://mmhaskell.com/blog/2025/4/21/solvehs-module-4-now-available>*
*Published: 2025-04-21T08:30:00.000Z*

Back in 2023, I introduced [Solve.hs](https://academy.mondaymorninghaskell.com/p/solve-hs), my newest course focused on problem solving in Haskell. This course was inspired by my experiences solving programming puzzles with Haskell, especially by the feeling of how different it was compared to other languages.

Solve.hs will teach you all the core knowledge you need around data structures and algorithms to tackle not only these kinds of puzzles (which often appear as interview questions), but also the mindset shifts you have to make when solving them **in Haskell**.

In 2023, I released the first two modules, which focused on **data structures**, with a special emphasis on how Haskell uses **linked lists**. These also explored the patterns that replace **’for’ and ‘while’ loops** from other languages.

Then in 2024 I released module 3, which explained all of the most **essential algorithms** in great detail, and showed how we have to implement them differently in Haskell.

Finally, today, I am releasing the fourth and final module for this course! This module explains **parsing** in great detail. You’ll learn:

1.  Basic string manipulation techniques for simple parsing
2.  How to use libraries to parse common data formats (e.g. JSON)
3.  How to use the [Megaparsec library](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/megaparsec) to parse any other kind of structured data
4.  How to write your own monadic parser
5.  How to use regular expressions for parsing in Haskell

These skills can be important in puzzle solving challenges where your input is just a string. But they’re also applicable in a wide variety of “real world” projects!

For the next 2 weeks, you can get [Solve.hs](https://academy.mondaymorninghaskell.com/p/solve-hs) for 20% off with the code **SOLVE25**. You can also get an **extra** 10% discount by [subscribing](https://www.mmhaskell.com/subscribe) to our newsletter!

After these 2 weeks are up, you’ll not only lose the discount, but the price of the course will **go up** to reflect the added material from module 4. This course will never be cheaper, so grab it now by going to the [course page](https://academy.mondaymorninghaskell.com/p/solve-hs)!

# AI assisted search-based research actually works now

*Source: <https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/21/ai-assisted-search/#atom-entries>*
*Published: 2025-04-21T12:57:58.000Z*

For the past two and a half years the feature I've most wanted from LLMs is the ability to take on search-based research tasks on my behalf. We saw the first glimpses of this back in early 2023, with Perplexity (first launched [December 2022](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perplexity_AI), first prompt leak [in January 2023](https://simonwillison.net/2023/Jan/22/perplexityai/)) and then the GPT-4 powered Microsoft Bing (which launched/cratered spectacularly [in February 2023](https://simonwillison.net/2023/Feb/15/bing/)). Since then a whole bunch of people have taken a swing at this problem, most notably [Google Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/) and [ChatGPT Search](https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-search/).

Those 2023-era versions were promising but very disappointing. They had a strong tendency to hallucinate details that weren't present in the search results, to the point that you couldn't trust anything they told you.

In this first half of 2025 I think these systems have finally crossed the line into being genuinely useful.

*   [How does the economic model for the Web work now?](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/21/ai-assisted-search/#how-does-the-economic-model-for-the-web-work-now-)

#### Deep Research, from three different vendors

First came the **Deep Research** implementations - [Google Gemini](https://blog.google/products/gemini/google-gemini-deep-research/) and [then OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/introducing-deep-research/) and [then Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/hub/blog/introducing-perplexity-deep-research) launched products with that name and they were all impressive: they could take a query, then churn away for several minutes assembling a lengthy report with dozens (sometimes hundreds) of citations. Gemini's version had a _huge_ upgrade a few weeks ago when they [switched it to using Gemini 2.5 Pro](https://blog.google/products/gemini/deep-research-gemini-2-5-pro-experimental/), and I've had some outstanding results from it since then.

Waiting a few minutes for a 10+ page report isn't my ideal workflow for this kind of tool. I'm impatient, I want answers faster than that!

#### o3 and o4-mini are really good at search

Last week, OpenAI released [search-enabled o3 and o4-mini](https://openai.com/index/introducing-o3-and-o4-mini/) through [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/). On the surface these look like the same idea as we've seen already: LLMs that have the option to call a search tool as part of replying to a prompt.

But there's one _very significant_ difference: these models can run searches as part of the chain-of-thought reasoning process they use before producing their final answer.

This turns out to be a _huge_ deal. I've been throwing all kinds of questions at ChatGPT (in o3 or o4-mini mode) and getting back genuinely useful answers grounded in search results. I haven't spotted a hallucination yet, and unlike prior systems I rarely find myself shouting "no, don't search for _that_!" at the screen when I see what they're doing.

Here are four recent example transcripts:

*   [Get me specs including VRAM for RTX 5090 and RTX PRO 6000 - plus release dates and prices](https://chatgpt.com/share/6805758b-acc8-8006-88a3-bdd78866ee15)
*   [Find me a website tool that lets me paste a URL in and it gives me a word count and an estimated reading time](https://chatgpt.com/share/68057580-02c8-8006-8ff4-7ae3ce816342)
*   [Figure out what search engine ChatGPT is using for o3 and o4-mini](https://chatgpt.com/share/6805756c-4268-8006-82ab-014f7c304622)
*   [Look up Cloudflare r2 pricing and use Python to figure out how much this (screenshot of dashboard) costs](https://chatgpt.com/share/6805755b-4aa0-8006-ab0b-42ae569da6a8)

Talking to o3 feels like talking to a Deep Research tool in real-time, without having to wait for several minutes for it to produce an overly-verbose report.

My hunch is that doing this well requires a very strong reasoning model. Evaluating search results is hard, due to the need to wade through huge amounts of spam and deceptive information. The disappointing results from previous implementations usually came down to the Web being full of junk.

Maybe o3, o4-mini and Gemini 2.5 Pro are the first models to cross the gullibility-resistance threshold to the point that they can do this effectively?

#### Google and Anthropic need to catch up

The user-facing [Google Gemini app](https://gemini.google.com/) can search too, but it doesn't show me what it's searching for. As a result, I just don't trust it. Compare these examples from o3 and Gemini for the prompt "Latest post by Simon Willison" - o3 is much more transparent:

It seems his blog might not always reflect his absolute latest thoughts and shorter updates, which he often shares on platforms like Mastodon.](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/search-gemini.jpg)

This is a big missed opportunity since Google presumably have by far the best search index, so they really should be able to build a great version of this. And Google's AI assisted search on their regular search interface hallucinates _wildly_ to the point that it's actively damaging their brand. I just checked and Google is still showing slop [for Encanto 2](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/29/encanto-2/)!

Claude also finally [added web search](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/20/) a month ago but it doesn't feel nearly as good. It's [using the Brave search index](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/21/anthropic-use-brave/) which I don't think is as comprehensive as Bing or Gemini, and searches don't happen as part of that powerful reasoning flow.

#### Lazily porting code to a new library version via search

The truly magic moment for me came [a few days ago](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/18/gemini-image-segmentation/#gemini-2-5-flash-non-thinking).

My [Gemini image segmentation tool](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/18/gemini-image-segmentation/) was using the [@google/generative-ai](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@google/generative-ai) library which has been [loudly deprecated](https://github.com/google-gemini/deprecated-generative-ai-js) in favor of the still in preview [Google Gen AI SDK @google/genai](https://github.com/googleapis/js-genai) library.

I did **not** feel like doing the work to upgrade. On a whim, I pasted [my full HTML code](https://github.com/simonw/tools/blob/aa310a4f9cde07d5e8e87572f70fceca532884dd/gemini-mask.html) (with inline JavaScript) into ChatGPT o4-mini-high and prompted:

> `This code needs to be upgraded to the new recommended JavaScript library from Google. Figure out what that is and then look up enough documentation to port this code to it.`

(I couldn't even be bothered to look up the name of the new library myself!)

... it did [exactly that](https://chatgpt.com/share/68028f7b-11ac-8006-8150-00c4205a2507). It churned away thinking for 21 seconds, ran a bunch of searches, figured out the new library (which existed _way_ outside of its training cut-off date), found the [upgrade instructions](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/migrate) and produced [a new version](https://github.com/simonw/tools/commit/d199de213dc3f866a3b8efbcdd2dde34204dc409) of my code that worked perfectly.

![Screenshot of AI assistant response about upgrading Google Gemini API code. Shows "Thought for 21 seconds" followed by web search results for "Google Gemini API JavaScript library recommended new library" with options including Google AI for Developers, GitHub, and Google for Developers. The assistant explains updating from GoogleGenerativeAI library to @google-ai/generative, with code samples showing: import { GoogleGenAI } from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@google/genai@latest'; and const ai = new GoogleGenAI({ apiKey: getApiKey() });](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/o4-thinking.jpg)

I ran this prompt on my phone out of idle curiosity while I was doing something else. I was _extremely_ impressed and surprised when it did exactly what I needed.

#### How does the economic model for the Web work now?

I'm writing about this today because it's been one of my "can LLMs do this reliably yet?" questions for over two years now. I think they've just crossed the line into being useful as research assistants, without feeling the need to check _everything_ they say with a fine-tooth comb.

I still don't trust them not to make mistakes, but I think I might trust them enough that I'll skip my own fact-checking for lower-stakes tasks.

This also means that a bunch of the potential dark futures we've been predicting for the last couple of years are a whole lot more likely to become true. Why visit websites if you can get your answers directly from the chatbot instead?

The lawsuits over this [started flying](https://simonwillison.net/2023/Dec/31/ai-in-2023/#ethics-diabolically-complex) back when the LLMs were still mostly rubbish. The stakes are a lot higher now that they're actually good at it!

I can feel my usage of Google search taking a nosedive already. I expect a bumpy ride as a new economic model for the Web lurches into view.

**2:** In a 2003 Belgian election, the Communist candidate got 4096 extra votes; [investigators suspect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_voting_in_Belgium#Reported_problems) a cosmic ray flipped a bit in the voting machine.

**3:** [Anatoly Karlin highlights (X)](https://x.com/powerfultakes/status/1892003738929238408) a section from Walter Isaacson’s Musk biography claiming that his father Errol, previously a successful engineer, suddenly became a crackpot in his forties:

> One day \[Musk’s cousin\] Peter came over to the house and found Errol sitting in his underwear at the kitchen table with a plastic roulette wheel. He was trying to see whether microwaves could affect it. He would spin the wheel, mark down the result, then spin it and put it in a microwave oven and record the result. “It was nuts”, Peter says. Errol had become convinced that he could find a system for beating the game. He dragged Elon to the Pretoria casino many times, dressing him up so that he looked older than sixteen, and had him write down the numbers while Errol used a calculator hidden under a betting card.
>
> Elon went to the library and read a few books on roulette and even wrote a roulette simulation program on his computer. He then tried to convince his father that none of his schemes would work. But Errol believed that he had found a deeper truth about probability and, as he later described it to me, an “almost total solution to what is called randomness.” When I asked him to explain it, he said, “There are no ‘random events’ or ‘chance.’ All events follow the Fibonacci Sequence, like the Mandelbrot Set. I went on to discover the relationship between ‘chance’ and the Fibonacci Sequence. This is the subject for a scientific paper. If I share it, all activities relying on ‘chance’ will be ruined, so I am in doubt as to doing that.”
>
> I’m not quite sure what all that means. Neither is Elon: “I don’t know how he went from being great at engineering to believing in witchcraft. But he somehow made that evolution.” Errol can be very forceful and occasionally convincing. “He changes reality around him”, Kimbal says. “He will literally make up things, but he actually believes his own false reality.”

This is the main data point that keeps me from 100% believing the “it’s all ketamine” theory. Related: [A Ketamine Addict’s Perspective On Musk](https://alisoncrosthwait.substack.com/p/a-ketamine-addicts-perspective-on).

**4:** Did you know there’s [a Hunting Of The Snark musical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsRuIV_83XA&list=PLb50fPsk2OD4yg3THHMGPPO6ipeRX825j)?

It’s okay, but the poem itself is too repetitive to set to music directly, so they had to reset it into a different rhyming, rhythmic form, and taking one of the best English poems and re-writing it without making it worse is a tough order that I’m not sure they managed.

**5:** [The Pilate Cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilate_cycle) is a collection of Christian apocrypha. In one work, _The Acts of Pilate_, Satan tries to convince the Greek god Hades to trap Jesus in the Greek underworld (but ends up trapped himself). Another, _The Vengeance Of The Savior_, is a “revenge fantasy” that daydreams about horrible deaths for Pilate, Herod, and, uh, all Jews.

**6:** [Why did Doordash win?](https://www.danhock.co/p/why-did-doordash-win) Now that I think about it, I haven’t heard much from GrubHub or UberEats lately. The article speculates that DoorDash started with some good strategic choices (organizing their own delivery fleet, starting in suburbs), then executed better than their competitors.

**7:** A common sociological claim is that relative income (compared to your social circle) matters more for happiness than absolute income. [Bryan Caplan thinks this can’t be true](https://www.betonit.ai/p/be-relatively-rich-the-easy-way): after all, practically nobody moves to poorer areas to enjoy the higher relative income this would confer. I don’t know if you can really use revealed preferences this way - exercise and meditation plausibly make you happier, but most people don’t do them. On the other hand, there are _enough_ people who do them and praise them that we all know somebody like this. Where are the people who coincidentally ended up living in the slums and love it?

**8: [“](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RhkcJyhg0E)**[The most accurate AI-generated DMT hallucinations so far.”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RhkcJyhg0E) A+, this is a great genre of thing.

**9:** Twelve years ago, I wrote about some interesting medical hypotheses on the productive border between crackpottery and consensus. One was Drs. Gat and Goren’s claim that prostate disease comes from venous insufficiency and can be treated surgically. Norman Yarvin [digs much deeper](https://yarchive.net/blog/prostate/) and concludes it’s plausible. Great piece at the intersection of biomedicine and physics - if you want to think about the circulatory system in a sensible way, you need to _really_ understand pressure.

**10:** In my [report card](https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/preliminary-milei-report-card) last October, I said that Milei had reduced Argentine monthly inflation from 25% to 4%, but there was still a long way to go. The latest news is that [it’s dropped further to 2.2%](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/argentina-inflation-rate-seen-hitting-milei-era-low-2025-02-13/). And poverty, which went up during the “shock therapy”, is now [lower than when Milei took office](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/poverty-hit-argentines-rummage-food-even-economic-outlook-improves-2025-03-31/).

**11:** Update on [Ozempocalypse](https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/the-ozempocalypse-is-nigh): some pharmacies have stopped selling compounded GLP-1 drugs, [others continue](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/21/zepbound-copycats-tirzepatide-compounding-online-fda-ban.html), with various flimsy legal excuses. Cremieux [has a guide (partly subscriber-only)](https://www.cremieux.xyz/p/how-to-get-cheap-ozempic) on how to order and use cheap “research chemical” GLP-1 from from peptide companies. And the Trump administration [cancelled a Biden initiative](https://apnews.com/article/trump-medicare-coverage-wegovy-zepbound-54bf291135fa9efec7d0ad9672c850a1) to make GLP-1 drugs available via insurance.

**13:** Local pharma startup founder Trevor Klee is working on [a supplement that prevents your body from absorbing plasticizers in food](https://neutraoat.com/). These aren’t exactly the same as microplastics, but are probably also bad. You would have to take the supplement with every meal - but surely no price is too high if it keeps you safe from . . . whatever it is that plasticizers do.

**16:** _[Trump Tower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_Tower_\(novel\))_ is a BDSM erotic novel published in 2011. It was originally credited to Donald Trump as author (with Jeffrey Robinson as ghostwriter), but at the last moment Trump changed his mind, and Robinson was listed as the author. I appreciated [Ozy Brennan's review of Saddam Hussein’s erotic novel](https://thingofthings.substack.com/p/i-read-saddam-husseins-romance-novel), and nominate them to cover this one too.

They were cajoled into pretending to be a band for a Harp Lager commercial but needed a keyboard player. Devlin said he knew a Jim Lockhart who would fit the bill.

**21:** More new-ish AI policy substacks potentially worth your time:

*   You may remember Helen Toner from the OpenAI board drama, but she’s also an experienced and thoughtful scholar on AI policy and now has a Substack, [Rising Tide](https://helentoner.substack.com/). I especially appreciated [Nonproliferation Is The Wrong Approach To AI Misuse](https://helentoner.substack.com/p/nonproliferation-is-the-wrong-approach).

*   You may remember Miles Brundage from OpenAI Safety Team Quitting Incident #25018 (or maybe 25019, I can’t remember). He’s got [an AI policy Substack too](https://milesbrundage.substack.com/), [here’s](https://milesbrundage.substack.com/p/dialogue-with-dean-ball-on-his-private) a dialogue with Dean Ball.

**22:** And speaking of the board drama, a new book finally reveals most of the story, and the real reason behind Altman’s firing was . . . he wasn’t consistently candid. Not sure what I expected.

The article doesn’t explain why the board did such a poor job communicating their grievances, maybe it’s in the full book. It does sound like part of board’s problem was that they were leaning heavily on Mira Murati but she was playing both sides off against each other.

**23:** And the Forethought Institute has been putting out some great analysis lately, including [Will AI R&D Automation Cause An Intelligence Explosion?](https://www.forethought.org/research/will-ai-r-and-d-automation-cause-a-software-intelligence-explosion), by Daniel Eth and Tom Davidson, and [AI Enabled Coups: How A Small Group Could Use AI To Seize Power](https://www.forethought.org/research/ai-enabled-coups-how-a-small-group-could-use-ai-to-seize-power), by Tom Davidson, Lukas Finnveden, and Rose Hadshar.

**26:** [Cremieux on birth order effects (X)](https://x.com/cremieuxrecueil/status/1909438671880962304). His conclusion: “The birth order effect is social. It is driven by parental interactions and investments, and sibling interactions that are dynamic with respect to age.”

**29:** Am I living in a conservative filter bubble? I keep hearing how we need a “reckoning” over the government’s disastrous anti-COVID policies, but [the latest YouGov polling](https://yougovamerica.substack.com/p/middling-approval-and-middle-ages) suggests that large majorities of Americans continue to support those policies:

**30:** A California legislator proposed a bill that would ban OpenAI’s nonprofit → forprofit conversion, backed by a suspiciously specific interest group, the [Coalition For AI Nonprofit Integrity](https://canicoalition.com/). I assume this is either Elon Musk or our conspiracy; not sure which. But their plan was stymied when the legislature [“amended”](https://www.sfexaminer.com/news/technology/california-bill-barring-openai-for-profit-transition-dead/article_27250d39-7577-47cc-a414-a7b13e5f6ce0.html) the bill to remove its entire text and replace it with unrelated text about airplane loans. The legislator apparently got cold feet after being warned it might inflict collateral damage on other companies, and because of [the way the California legislature works](https://www.pressdemocrat.com/article/news/how-california-lawmakers-gut-and-amend-bills-in-sacramento/) it’s sometimes more efficient to turn doomed bills into other bills than to simply withdraw them.

**31:** [EthnoGuessr](https://hbd.gg/) is a GeoGuessr variant: it shows you pictures of an ethnic group, you click on the map where you think they’re from. Warning that if you play this too much you might get into race science.

[

![Sample ethnic group from the game.](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbde5185a-2b93-4c07-904b-66d2c2311a53_1140x1033.png "Sample ethnic group from the game.")

Their source, [humanphenotypes.net](http://humanphenotypes.net/), divides humanity into a hundred or so ethnic groups. Although they cite sources, I don’t understand the philosophical basis of the classification. Also, 100 images is so few that you start memorizing them after a while. I hope they move on to real pictures of real people in naturalistic situations.

Remember, asking where someone is from ‘originally’ is a microaggression, but inferring it yourself based on their “mildly platyrrhine, high-rooted nose” is A-OK!

**32:** Farmkind has [a new version of their calculator](https://www.farmkind.giving/compassion-calculator) to determine meat offsets, eg how much do you have to donate to animal welfare charities to compensate for the animals you harm by eating meat. Does the average person really eat chicken 9x a week?

**33:** Not going to waste your time listing every bad thing Trump has done this month, but among the worst is sending innocent people to horrible Salvadorean prisons ([including](https://x.com/zackbeauchamp/status/1905008507444666792) one person picked up because he had an autism awareness tattoo in honor of his brother, which they mistook for a gang tattoo), then refusing to bring them back. I have seen a couple of people defend denying immigrants due process; I assume they will not be moved by humanitarian arguments, but I think there are some more practical considerations:

*   [Zaid Jilani](https://x.com/ZaidJilani/status/1906905057313886418) points out that if immigrants don’t get a right to due process, citizens also don’t get a right to due process, because the government can kidnap citizens, claim they’re immigrants, and the citizens can’t prove otherwise since they don’t get due process.

*   The Supreme Court [has long maintained](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/what-constitutional-rights-do-undocumented-immigrants-have) that immigrants have a right due process, including such bleeding-heart liberals as Antonin Scalia.

*   If you want to maintain a taboo, it often helps to keep things that look identical to it taboo. For example, to maintain the taboo against child porn, you might also want to ban AI-generated child porn where no actual children are harmed, because if you allow this, then the difference between a taboo act (watching real child porn) and an allowed act (watching AI-generated child porn) is just checking the label to see how a porn video was made, and it’s hard to maintain social outrage against people who are doing the same thing as lots of other people but except for checking labels. In the same way, colleges and other communities mix citizens and immigrants together so closely that it’s hard to tell who is who without asking. If the government can punish immigrants for speaking freely, then it’s hard to maintain bright-line outrage against it punishing citizens for speaking freely when the only difference is who has a green card vs. a passport, something that the person’s community might not even know.


**34:** Related: the Trump administration seems to be [refusing to comply with a 9-0 Supreme Court order](https://www.thebulwark.com/p/what-is-john-roberts-thinking) to bring back a specific deported immigrant. This is obviously terrifying, but superforecaster Peter Wildeford says [it is not technically a constitutional crisis yet](https://x.com/peterwildeford/status/1912492747103121420) (X) because there are still some formalities the courts need to go to before they have officially “ordered” Trump to bring back the immigrant, and he won’t have officially “defied” the order until the formalities are complete. This doesn’t make me too much calmer but I guess is good to keep in mind. Related: Nicholas Decker asks when a violation of the Constitution becomes the sort of wolf-at-the-door dictatorship [that we are supposed to violently rise up to prevent](https://substack.com/home/post/p-161504109); people are mad at him but I think you have to either admit that _some_ level of tyranny reaches this level or else just lie down and die. My proposed solution (drawing, of course, on medieval Iceland) is that the Supreme Court should be able to directly enforce its decisions by declaring violators to be “outlaws”; not only do outlaws lose the protection of the law, but anyone who uses force to defend of an outlaw becomes an outlaw themselves. See [here](https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/11/13/book-review-legal-systems-very-different-from-ours/) for discussion of the pluses and minuses of such a system.

**35:** One bright spot in the political climate: [FIRE](https://www.thefire.org/) (Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression), originally founded to protect students from cancel culture, has done a great job pivoting to protect students from getting deported over pro-Palestine views. I am impressed with their principled stance and have donated. In related news, [FIRE has partnered with Substack to defend writers](https://www.thefire.org/news/defending-free-speech-fire-and-substack-partner-protect-writers-america), and FIRE president Greg Lukianoff has co-written an article with Dean Ball on [free speech and AI regulation](https://eternallyradicalidea.com/p/how-state-ai-regulations-threaten).

**36:** AI [can now generate](https://test-time-training.github.io/video-dit/) short Tom and Jerry cartoons to a prompt.

**37:** [Yali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yali_\(politician\)) was a New Guinea tribesman who fought with the Australians in World War II. After the war, the Australians tried to use him as a spokesperson to introduce New Guinea tribesmen to the civilized world. But Yali was both power-hungry and didn’t really understand civilization, so he ended up as the prophet of a new cargo cult instead. “People continued to give him gifts, and he collected a fee for baptising Christians who wanted to wash away the sins of Christianity and return to paganism.”

**38:** [National Catholic Reporter](https://www.ncronline.org/opinion/guest-voices/will-musk-and-trump-go-hell-defunding-corporal-works-mercy) comes on strong: “If you believe the Scripture is the Word of God, the message is clear: Musk and Trump will go to hell for defunding the corporal works of mercy.”

**39:** [Misinformation Is Not A Contagious Virus You Can Be Inoculated Against](https://www.conspicuouscognition.com/p/misinformation-isnt-a-contagious). An argument between two sets of misinformation researchers about the title metaphor. I think this is a linguistic misunderstanding: Dan uses “misinformation” to mean “false things”, and Sander uses it to mean “viral clickbait hyperpartisan slop of a sort which is at very high risk of being false”. I think Dan’s meaning is more natural and less likely to cause trouble.

**40:** California’s experiment to see how high they could raise the minimum wage before getting visible employment effects has [finally produced](https://x.com/LevyAntoine/status/1909646718502944900) (X) unambiguous results:

# Can Humanity Choose Its Future?

*Source: <https://www.overcomingbias.com/p/can-humanity-choose-its-future>*
*Published: 2025-04-23T18:06:10.000Z*

For all my lifetime, futurists have had a dream, of humanity coming together to consciously decide its fate. In the past, the world was too fragmented and competitive for any one group’s decisions to have global effects. But today, we do in fact have global conversations on humanity’s situation, and on policies to change its directions.

Long ago I worried that world governments would be required to direct global changes, and that they’d suffer from special problems of rot and accountability. But in fact even without a world government, the world now has strong convergence on many policies, resulting from global conversations on those policiers.

The reason is that we now have a shared world monoculture, especially among the elites who set most policies. So conversations among these elites do mould and reflect a shared world culture, which gets embodied in the policies of most governments and high prestige orgs around the world. World policies converge, even without a world government.

However, the shared world monoculture is itself a big problem, and will likely cause this shared world civilization to fall, to be replaced by others. And there isn’t much hope that in this shared conversation of this monoculture we will together decide to fragment into competing disagreeing parts.

It is thus much harder than it might seem for humanity to collectively choose its future. So far, our superpower is cultural evolution. But that only works when we are split into different enough competing cultures. If we join together into a single culture, we can decision things together more easily then, but that unit which we decide over will decay and be replaced by others.

It might be possible to someday make a world government that encompassed many quite different cultures. But then we couldn’t rely so much on a shared culture to help manage the conversations in which that government negotiated its policies. And without a shared culture it seems much harder to maintain the legitimacy and dominion of such a government. Even so, maybe it will happen someday.

# Songs Regulate Emotion

*Source: <https://www.overcomingbias.com/p/songs-express-emotion>*
*Published: 2025-04-22T17:18:55.000Z*

The point I make in this post is quite unlikely to be original. But I can’t be bothered to search more for prior sources.

Children spend a lot of time crying. And also in enthusiastic joy. For these and other cases, adults teach kids to regulate their emotions. To control your emotions more than they control you. Most strong emotional displays are seen as immature, and show the displayer to be weak.

Adults thus learn to be wary of strong emotional expressions, especially poorly controlled ones. When we express emotions, it is important that we are seen to be regulating them, expressing only the types and levels appropriate to the context.

But this leaves us with a lot of emotions that we feel more strongly than we express. We fill this deficit in part by expressing more emotions in private than in public. And by treasuring our most intimate relations, where we can sometimes let our emotions overwhelm us. But that is still not enough.

I suspect that filling this gap is one of the main social functions of music (and stories). In a song, the singer expresses an emotion in a way that makes it especially easy for us to see what they feel, and to join them in expressing a similar feeling via listening or singing along. But song expressions are safer than typical human expressions of emotions in many ways.

For example, our emotional reaction to a song is muted by it not being directly about our personal life; we are officially sympathizing with someone elses’ situation, not our own. Once we’ve heard a song once, its predictability ensures that our emotions stay within predictable and acceptable bounds. Knowing that others enjoy the same song gives social proof that its emotions are acceptable. And most important, songwriters pick cases of relatively respectable emotions, that don’t much suggest immaturity or weakness.

Teens are the adults most in need of acceptable outlets for strong emotions, and they are the biggest fans of music. Teens are also the people most into “cool”, i.e. showing exaggeratedly strong control over emotions. And so teens naturally prefer “cool” songs, wherein singers seem fully committed to their strength-showing emotions, and are not hesitant or embarrassed about those emotions.

This social function of songs makes them especially potent as a means of cultural transmission. Songs show us what emotions are acceptable or desirable, and in what situations. Cultures have often shown their disapproval of particular emotions via disapproving of related music. And thus cultural activists have often craved influence over changes to songs, as that often has outsized influence over perceived appropriate emotion-situation mappings.

# Adaptive Status Markers

*Source: <https://www.overcomingbias.com/p/adaptive-status-markers>*
*Published: 2025-04-21T20:00:33.000Z*

As polls and asking LLMs [didn’t](https://www.overcomingbias.com/p/status-marker-polls) give me much insight into which status markers are more adaptive, let me try to think the issue through myself. Here are six levels of status marker adaptiveness.

1 - **Wasteful Signs:** Consumption, Learning, Taste, Medicine - Signs of individual quality that induce great wasteful efforts to increase them.

2 - **Safe Signs**: Health, Looks - Signs of individual quality where its harder to waste lots in efforts to increase them.

3 - **Norm Following**: Honor/Loyalty, Generosity, Spiritual Purity, Honesty, Fairness - If your culture has good norms, there should be added value in rewarding adherence to them.

4 - **Copy**: Accomplished, Lineage: If your culture has good status markers, and good ways to evaluate accomplishments, then using these as status markers copies the good effects of other markers.

5 - **Persuasion**: Fame, Write/Talk Ability: Getting outsiders to adopt your cultural elements can be a big win in cultural evolution. But they have to be wiling to listen.

6 - **Power**: Power, Wealth, Autonomy: These directly and robustly enable your culture to win its conflicts with others, whether or not they are willing to listen.

6 - **Conditional Levers**: Inventive/creative , Combat Ability: In the right sort of cultural context, these greatly help your culture win its conflicts. And as they benefit the group more than the individual, they are especially good to encourage.

7 **Fertility**: This is just a robust direct win for your culture, if you can sustain it.

These scores (1-7) correlate 0.54 with polls on status averaged over history, but only 0.25 with US today. Suggesting cultural drift: status markers are less adaptive lately.

# Status Marker Polls

*Source: <https://www.overcomingbias.com/p/status-marker-polls>*
*Published: 2025-04-21T15:55:34.000Z*

In an attempt to learn more about status, I asked some polls comparing status markers. I picked 16 status markers and asked 9 poll sets, on which “[are you proudest in yourself](https://x.com/robinhanson/status/1913412002111693205)”, “[count most for status in your world](https://x.com/robinhanson/status/1913415309840486849)”, “[have counted most for status over all history](https://x.com/robinhanson/status/1913419367930306820)”, in your world count most for status among [lower](https://x.com/robinhanson/status/1913600234946437162), [middle](https://x.com/robinhanson/status/1913601867306700811), [upper](https://x.com/robinhanson/status/1913603284163535271) classes, over history count most for status among [men](https://x.com/robinhanson/status/1913645412382105853) and [women](https://x.com/robinhanson/status/1913646541916770324), and “[make a culture more adaptive](https://x.com/robinhanson/status/1913781386445570430).”

These are priorities relative to a max of 100 each, sorted by sum of priorities, followed by correlations.

Note that proud of in self and adaptive correlate 0.87, status overall in your world and in the upper class of your world correlate 0.90, and status overall in history and among men in history correlate 0.91. Thus we plausibly like to say that the markers we have are most adaptive, and we are biased to focus on the upper class of our world and on men in history. Note that men in history and upper class today correlate 0.75, both easy to criticize “[up](https://www.overcomingbias.com/p/types-of-partiality?utm_source=publication-search)” groups.

I also asked four LLMs to rank these markers, plus one additional, in terms of all history, US today, and adaptiveness. Here are their averaged results, compared to averaged poll results:

[

The ranks among the four LLMs tried correlate with each other 0.86 for all history, 0.87 for US today, and 0.78 re adaptive. LLMs correlated 0.90 with polls on US today, but only 0.61 and 0.71 re history and adaptive.

When she was 10 years old, Rose Yu got a birthday present that would change her life — and, potentially, the way we study physics. Her uncle got her a computer. That was a rare commodity in China 25 years ago, and the gift did not go unused. At first, Yu mainly played computer games, but in middle school she won an award for web design. It was the first of many computer-related honors.

# A Way Forward

> “For example, if one believes that affirmative action is good for black people, does it make sense to demand affirmative action in hostile or dogmatic terms? Obviously it would be more productive to take a diplomatic and conciliatory approach that would make at least verbal and symbolic concessions to white people who think that affirmative action discriminates against them. But leftist activists do not take such an approach because it would not satisfy their emotional needs.”

> – Unabomber Manifesto

To date, the Trump administration has been an absolute tragedy. It has been the acting out of emotions. There are no adults in the room. I’m not saying there would have been adults in the room with the Kamala _regime_ either, but I had some hopes for positive change with the Trump tech-bro alliance and now they are gone. At least truths are being laid bare versus heads being buried in the sands of _joy_, but I think there was a much better way.

For example, I don’t support America funding the war in Ukraine. But the way Zelensky was treated is just _dumb_. See the Unabomber quote above, between this and the Munich speech, Mr. JD Vance, I hope your emotional needs are being met (at the expense of the good will of our allies).

### It's the economy, stupid

Regardless of anyone’s long-term objectives in the US, be they decoupling from China, bringing manufacturing to the US, bringing lifestyle improvements to US citizens; I think it’s unquestionable that _uncertainty_ about the future was needlessly increased. And unless the uncertainty was the goal, I can’t figure out why things were done the way they were. And if the uncertainty was the goal…uhhh…is our government captured by Russian or Chinese agents? Because that’s [who benefits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cui_bono%3F).

I don’t trust the news very much. I have no idea if the guy in the El Salavdor prison had a fair trial, if the students being deported are criminals, or even if they are being deported at all. It’s really hard and time consuming to get to the truth about any of these things.

![](/blog/assets/images/snp500_crash.png)

However, when markets crash. that is obviously real. With the news, there’s usually no way to trade on it being real or fake, there’s nobody to take the other side. But with big public markets, there’s very deep liquidity if you think they are _priced wrong_.

![](/blog/assets/images/dollar_crash.png)

In addition to the 10% the market is down, the dollar is also down 10%. Considering the market is priced in dollars, it’s closer to 20% down. And even worse on top of all of this, prices are going up due to the tariffs.

Was crashing the economy the goal? A side-effect of a greater plan? Because given how this was executed, a 3-week old LLM could have told you shit was gonna crash.

And it’s [not going to bring manufacturing back](https://www.molsonhart.com/blog/america-underestimates-the-difficulty-of-bringing-manufacturing-back). I have done manufacturing in America for years, and anyone with any experience could have told you that this wouldn’t work, manufacturing requires long term investment and long term investment requires stability.

What was the real goal here?

### Elon, you need to reconcile with your daughter

Andrew Callaghan [did a good piece on Elon’s radicalization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAOi7EhmA_8). I get it, we have all been there. For me it was Gamergate (which still has a terrible wikipedia page that doesn’t explain what it was). But this doesn’t have to be you forever. You are the closest thing to an adult in any room in America.

![](/blog/assets/images/space_launch_2024.jpg)

When you compare America to China, it’s really more like comparing Elon to China. ULA is a little joke compared to CNSA. And look into what percent of US car exports are Teslas. The man is singlehandedly beating the rest of the US combined. If you want any hope of standing against China, your political coalition better include him.

Elon has been pretty politically quiet lately. I’m sure [he knew exactly what would happen with the tariffs](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/04/07/musk-trump-tariffs/), but he couldn’t stop them. I got fooled too, thought it could be different this time. But it’s [no different from 2017](https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/1/15726292/elon-musk-trump-advisory-council-paris-climate-decision). (btw, we are finally beating climate change thanks to cheap solar panels from China)

I know the idea of PR is against a lot of what you believe in, but you need to heads down put together a large scale PR campaign, distance yourself from this train wreck, denounce stupid fake right wing conspiracy theories, reconcile with your daughter (from a reader of sci-fi and The Culture, is the trans thing that hard to understand?), resolve your stupid beef with OpenAI (we are all disappointed, but you don’t have a great track record for open source either), and start building a new political party.

*   Pro large scale skilled legal immigration, not a single illegal border crosser.
*   Pro choice (within reason), and also pro gun (within reason).
*   Inclusive and diverse, with an unwavering focus on merit.
*   Anti crime, with an understanding that victimless crime is not crime.
*   Expose higher education and the medical system to the free market (watch how fast prices fall)
*   Free market and trade, but not an unregulated market. Markets require regulation to be free.

It’s probably the only shot we have against China. The current Republicans and Democrats are just far too stupid; the Chinese are watching this tariff drama and laughing their asses off. Their plans are measured in centuries.

* * *



### America, do you want to be a protectionist backwater?

If so, and all the [thymos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thumos) is gone, then there’s no place for me there. If this is really the way things are going, the only thing for anyone to do is leave.

We’ll see how it shapes up in the next few years. But if the [racists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_\(United_States\)) or the [other racists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_\(United_States\)) are still running the show, we really are just cooked. Enjoy your handouts to black people and your handouts to white people in a poverty stricken shithole.

# How to make an Android tablet respect my wish to stay on a WiFi with no internet access?

*Source: <https://lobste.rs/s/okm5za/how_make_android_tablet_respect_my_wish>*
*Published: 2025-04-23T23:03:13.000Z*

I have a Lenovo android tablet for controlling my Behringer XR12 mixer. I connect the tablet to the mixer via a Wifi access point built into the mixer. For obvious reasons this wifi access point doesn’t have internet access, and this is a feature: I don’t want to be distracted my messages or new email during performances.

So far so good.

There is one fly in the ointment. Periodically the Android tablet opens a browser window, in the foreground, trying to load the google.com front page. I have so far failed to find a setting that can make it stop doing this. Internet search have so far been fruitless. I only find articles aimed at folks that has the opposite problem: they want to get on the internet, but can’t. I want to NOT be on the internet, but I can’t make my tablet respect this.

Anybody have any suggestions?
